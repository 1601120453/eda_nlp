0	aggressive self glorification and a manipulative whitewash 
1	stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory 
0	none of the characters or plot lines are fleshed out enough to build any interest 
0	the whole film has this sneaky feel to it as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product
