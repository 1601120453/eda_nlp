1	product this is an outstanding product one that lives up to the pr

1	range the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time 
1	set up the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result

0	updating firmware only issue is with updating firmware

0	work unfortunately i just could not get it to work 
0	support d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful 
1	support this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block 
1	switch the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link

1	working the router has port gig ethernet switch and wireless access point ap rrb n working flawlessly 
1	router in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you 
0	router more than likely if you are forking over the money for this router you have higher needs and expectations which this router does nt meet 
0	guest network well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working 
0	gui with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work

0	router i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this

1	setup the dir was so easy to setup it was almost too easy 
0	firmware or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do 
0	slowed down this router started out looking good but then gradually slowed down to the point that even standard def youtube videos and highly compressed iptv from hulu plus would slow down and freeze or stutter 
0	labeling of firmware the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires

1	return policy thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part 
1	firmware update my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product

0	instructions meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers 
1	software the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features 
0	product exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back
