1	stands wire i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base 
1	front channels i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels 
0	stands speakers one thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down

1	price point in addition the price point is spectacular 
1	computer speakers these are the only computer speakers i ve ever bought so i have no comparison to anything else 
0	subwoofer the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers

1	speakers if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for 
0	tonal qualities what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor 
0	speaker crossovers there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers 
0	mid range bass you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels 
1	computer speaker however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb

0	satellites cons i think the satellites look ugly 
0	sub woofer ported sub woofer not appropriate for this set up 
1	speakers this is a preference but since these speakers are more than capable of loud levels i d be willing to sacrifice some efficiency to have an enclosed woofer that is much more accurate and less redolent of a teenager is car system 
0	speaker cable fixed speaker cable why do this 
1	sub woofer sub woofer is large 
1	computer speaker for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary

1	system this is a superb system and highly recommended

1	stereo reproduction the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior 
1	clarity vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well 
1	design sound quality obviously one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage 
1	works sound size price i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower 
0	bass system first of all i disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way 
1	sound they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers 
0	mid range mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers

1	price sound bass bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass 
1	speakers these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park 
1	mount use the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars 
0	bigger it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone 
1	speakers sound i believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your desktop computer or laptop i try this at bestbuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker now when i got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok i have a mac and i wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it is a nightmare to find a fully compatible pci card i found a great plug in for mac i tunes srs iwow after installing the demo i was totally impress by the quality of sound just a great alternative for mac users 
1	loud my brother and i were equally shocked at how loud this thing really is

1	sound the sound became instantly clear again 
1	small upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them 
0	design there are a few things that i do nt like about the design

1	dvd r that is a rare and valuable feature 
1	audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying 
1	forward at double speed it still plays mp s with sound they are pitch corrected and smooth but twice as fast 
0	remote control mp filename weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size

0	remote the remote is okay but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons 
0	button i especially like the more commonly used buttons such as play pause and stop to be larger and conveniently placed 
0	zoom mode i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode

0	color the other thing i do nt like about this is that it makes the color look over saturated

1	media it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player 
1	user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds 
1	player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high end player 
1	look panel and the slim form factor together with the mirror like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey

0	dvd player granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player 
0	menu first the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds

0	player i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died 
1	player i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category 
1	player i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine 
0	noise external display there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance

0	camera i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust 
0	grain the grain was terrible 
0	flash photo noise well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise 
1	photo when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome 
1	camera the camera was a marvel 
1	camera it is versatile and seems to be one of the best 
1	g i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images 
0	lag time flash the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash 
1	depth what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f 
0	flash relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr the internal flash on the g produces harsh flat images with ugly hot spots 
1	external flash hot shoe fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct 
1	flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon 
0	software now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to 
0	software the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera 
1	g what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g hardware 
1	color without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image 
0	software what the g raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical 
1	image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera 
1	raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits 
1	camera i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision 
1	camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well 
1	battery life battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves 
1	manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent downloading pictures is quick and a breeze and the quality is astounding 
1	service the service from the supplier was exceptional 
1	photo having used it for more than a month i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos 
1	photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced 
1	automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes 
0	viewfinder about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder 
1	camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera 
1	canon but canon never fails to amaze 
1	raw format the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing flexibility 
1	battery life battery life is over hours compared to about hours for the g or the hours for most nikons 
1	software the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing 
1	shape the shape of this device is a little squarer without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking 
1	light auto correction the light auto correction is awesome 
1	picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right 
1	white offset perhaps inspired by the canon is factory white correction settings the g has much sharper white offsets 
1	g overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view 
1	camera this is quite simply the best you can ask for 
0	low light focus the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds 
0	picture got way too many blurry pictures 
1	photo use software mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval 
1	camera the powershot g is a great camera 
1	photo because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos 
1	camera megapixels is plenty for all but pros and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera 
1	feature it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features 
0	unresponsiveness the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots 
0	delay it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button 
0	delay canon is g does it consistently 
0	focus shoot it feels slow to focus and unbearably slow to shoot 
0	g unfortunately this digital moment capturing device called the g sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted 
1	camera this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier 
1	picture quality i love the quality of the pictures 
1	picture quality they look fantastic 
1	mp camera the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there 
1	picture with canon you get pictures that appear to be photos not still camcorder shots 
1	control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus 
0	lens cap the included lens cap is very loose on the camera 
0	body the body construction buttons casing etc are too plastic 
0	casing it had a heavier and more sturdy casing

1	camera this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it 
1	battery life another point of note the battery life is incredible

1	menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera 
1	battery the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging 
1	optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom 
0	viewfinder one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder but does not detract from the image at all 
1	camera the best megapixel x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use 
1	camera because this camera is beautiful 
1	look the g looks like a work of art 
1	finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen 
1	camera i am very pleased with it so far 
0	viewfinder you can see the lens barrel in the view finder 
0	tiff format there is no tiff format 
0	lag it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter 
1	import it is very simple to import via iphoto and then move them to photoshop 
1	camera i am quite happy with the camera 
1	manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep 
1	camera yes i recommend it over the competition 
1	camera best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything 
1	stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website 
1	picture first and foremost it will take better pic is than most film camera is 
1	camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time 
1	camera however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice 
1	design feature use battery it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing 
1	display also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage 
0	compactflash one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough 
1	noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen 
1	camera i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything 
1	camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera 
1	use design in general it is easy to use and well laid out 
1	use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly 
1	feature the g has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi pro pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography 
1	auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode 
0	memory card the included memory card is too small 
0	made it is made of plastic 
0	lens the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot 
0	size while light it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets 
0	lever the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile 
0	flash flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost 
0	strap the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to 
1	camera the functionality on this camera is mind blowing 
1	option canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out 
1	learning learning how to use it will not take very long 
1	image quality the image quality is excellent 
1	function range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography 
1	camera this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used 
1	macro auto mode the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot 
1	camera this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel 
1	mp resolution i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology 
0	distortion yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture 
1	shot in terms of the shots taken this camera is insanely great 
1	picture learning curve the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to 
1	picture quality i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow car boat and wind 
1	camera the camera is a work of art science that is understood 
1	picture feel it takes great pictures operates quickly and feels solid 
0	viewfinder to address two previous somewhat negative reviews yes the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder however the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder 
0	design this camera has a major design flaw 
0	viewfinder when you look through the viewfinder the bottom left corner of the picture is blocked by the lens 
1	camera everything else about the camera is great 
1	camera if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder i highly recommend the camera 
1	camera and so far i ve been very pleased 
1	lens optical zoom the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer 
1	lcd the moveable lcd screen is great 
1	remote the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures 
1	hot shoe flash the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit 
1	battery i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse 
1	battery charging system the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery 
1	manual i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear 
0	highlight i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better 
0	no off button the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera 
0	body and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s 
1	download i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files 
1	camera i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it 
1	camera use photo very comfortable camera easy to use and the best digital photos you re going to get at this price 
1	g i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised 
1	camera all in all i believe this is arguably the best non slr digital camera on the market 
1	optic canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better 
1	digital camera simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point 
1	battery life the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon and is better than anything else i ve seen 
0	look the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots 
1	camera even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under 
1	camera definetely a great camera 
1	quality lens proven canon built quality and lens 
1	feel feels solid in hand 
1	sd we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd 
1	design it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point and shoot weve ever tested 
1	image processing system a digic ii powered image processing system enables the sd to snap a limitless stream of megapixel photos at a respectable clip its start up time is tops in its class and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition 
1	image the sd rivals the canon g in image quality 
0	pricey i thought given all the reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey 
0	lcd i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen 
0	lcd when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen cracked and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen black and blue and purple blotches and streaks useless 
1	camera this camera is truely superb 
1	pictures the startup time quality of pictures and videos is outstanding 
0	manual control some more manual control would have been nice 
1	pictures they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact 
1	canon i went out and got the canon today 
1	picture ive taken about hundred shot with the canon in varying lighting situations all in auto mode and not one blurry picture 
1	canon i did not conduct a rigorous test but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras and the canon won hands down 
1	pictures sharper pictures 
1	size the canon is very small definitely pocket size but still easy to hold firmly 
1	powers up it powers up quickly so you wont miss that quick shot 
0	flash the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered 
1	image good image quality 
1	pics user interface battery charger all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd are both rich and color and high in detail the user interface is awesome the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time 
0	lcd after reading reviews of lcd problems cracked black blobs etc i figured that it was probably a very limited problem 
0	lcd after pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings 
1	weight camera is a paper weight 
1	sd i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot images so far with it 
1	pictures the pictures are tack sharp colors are vivid and at mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire 
1	powerup powerup is quick and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on 
1	x mode quality i have especially enjoyed the x mode while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe 
0	camera shake you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with 
1	audio audio is mono and fairly acceptable quiet also with little distortions 
1	battery the battery life is not that of the casios but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got 
0	autofocus the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can 
0	compact i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature 
0	manual controls also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls 
1	image glad to see the ed revised the previous statements regarding image quality 
1	focuses my sd focuses flawlessly does not whine during video and my pictures are razor sharp 
1	camera this camera is bulletproof 
1	start up start up is so quick 
1	pictures you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on literally 
1	lcd big lcd screen at least for me is enough 
1	picture great picture quality in automatic mode quality is great 
1	quality when you learn how to change some settings you can make the quality even better 
1	zoom digital zoom is clear too say you used all x optical zoom try to do digital zoom then just try not to shake the camera at all and youll still get a clear good quality picture 
1	zoom great video clip quality for a digital camera so much better than my old one the megapixel one 
1	clips i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips i give it stars oh and btw while you take video clips you can zoom it too but still 
1	merge pictures photo stitch 
1	camera turn the camera on while pressing the button and itl show you the time and date 
0	battery battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times the camera battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but its normal 
0	sound the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera 
1	camera pictures i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures 
1	features if youll only read the whole manual youll find out even more cool features and youll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading 
1	camera its such a great camera i think it really was worth the investment 
1	designed if you havent noticed they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self timer 
1	made they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you dont like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self timer 
1	camera i bought this camera two days ago and im very pleased to say that it has been worth the money 
0	low light conditions only downside is when taking pictures in low light conditions without the flash 
1	automatic settings if you on the other hand always use automatic settings you should be just fine as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen 
1	camera all in all this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price 
1	digic ii chip having the digic ii chip helps a lot 
1	pictures size this camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat 
1	starts up i still cant believe how fast it starts up 
1	camera i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice 
1	sd i still have my s because i like the wider lens sometimes but in general if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package the sd is the only one you should buy 
1	edges i love the rounded edges now fits so much better in a pocket jeans or suit 
0	lcd the sd has only been in my possession for a little over months and the lcd has been broken twice 
0	lcd i took it out one day and the lcd was not working 
0	lcd although the sd takes great quality photos the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall 
1	camera i tell you now after lot of shooting in many different situations this camera is amazing 
1	size the size of the camera is perfect 
1	fits fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket 
1	camera there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things 
1	pictures i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher isos but i dont really care that much i think it gives the pictures a certain real life quality 
1	flash the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent 
1	camera id be happy to talk to anyone about this camera 
1	camera movie mode this camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot

1	camera ive only had this camera for a few days but its been great 
1	photo the photo quality is amazing 
1	feels looks its fast feels great in your hand and looks great too 
1	prints ive printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views 
1	image as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen 
1	colors video another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty price tag and get a quality camera 
1	camera moreover apart from the plastic cable cover the camera has a nice solid feel about it and its so tiny i take it with me wherever i go 
1	camera as it turns out this is an awesome camera 
1	preset user definable however this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes 
0	advanced controls i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd are not as robust but overall picture quality goes head to head with the digital rebel 
1	software documentatio the sd software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed 
1	camera bottom line this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck

1	camera this is overall the best point and shoot camera ive used

0	power button the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print share button dont have a nice click 
0	buttons the buttons are rather stiff 
1	switch i also tend to like the sliding cover on switch found on many compact ps cameras since its much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot 
1	build macros results video quality flash white balance overall build quality good macros results impressive video quality good pictures with flash excellent auto white balance 
1	camera could be better to be a perfect camera purple fringing details in high light area noise over iso red eyes processing artefacts loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light automatic autofocus whizing while video playback better video comression more manual controls longer lasting battery indicator for battery better protection of the lcd less weight 
1	camera image when the overall image quality is the most important thing then this camera ist top notch and very impressive 
1	flash in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p 
0	settings some adjustments in the settings could help make it better

0	controls the controls are hard to manipulate especially in the dark 
0	lcd the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones 
1	small i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason 
1	camera size im in high school and this camera is perfect for what i use it for carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to of my friends and of funny things that happen 
0	memory the only thing i dont like is the small size memory card that comes with it 
0	room i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next and i dont have enough money to buy the meg card that ive had my eye on for a while 
0	memory battery a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy 
0	pictures other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as id like them 
1	camera id say that this camera is perfect 
1	compact ok not quite everything but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it 
1	size i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it or have already bought it its size 
1	small it is amazingly small its hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera 
1	small durable it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket and i dont have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable 
1	covering there is also a small covering for the lens so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched 
1	picture small the picture quality surprised me when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good but i was wrong 
1	picture the picture quality of this camera is outstanding 
0	battery first off the battery 
0	battery this camera uses a lithium battery i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient because what if you are on vacation where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there 
0	battery not only is it inconvenient but also the battery life span is short 
0	batteries this isnt uncommon in cameras though just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries you should be fine 
0	zoom another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function 
0	zooms such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in wrong 
0	zoom the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet 
0	start up even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little resulting in a noisy start up 
0	flash the flash is very weak 
0	macro the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function 
0	auto focus the auto focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject 
0	work to make matters work there is no manual override to overcome this problem 
1	focus the focus is great though if you are not taking a macro shot 
0	cameras its not my first choice in cameras 
1	size i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size 
1	camera if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times then this is a great camera choice 
1	s after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace i decided on the s 
1	camera it has given me zero problems and the more i use it the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths 
0	small it is perhaps too small 
0	buttons read i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on 
0	size its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge 
0	delay shots the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots 
0	autofocus this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system 
0	resolution setting the lack of an intermediate resolution setting as other reviewers have suggested is a problem but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card 
0	hot the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away 
0	hot it is hot enough to be annoying 
1	small pictures this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo quality printer

1	camera i love this camera 
1	camera i dont believe this camera is still available but if you can find one you might like to get it

1	purchase i am very pleased with my purchase 
1	camera ive been incredibly happy with this camera 
1	camera this camera is great if youre used to a high end slr 
1	snapshots its overkill for simple snapshots unless youve got way too much money to blow 
1	exposure exposure compensation in stop increments 
1	flash mode slow syncro flash macro infinity mode etc 
1	body the ss body is wonderful feels high quality 
1	body its the same body as the popular elp aps camera 
0	lcd i left the camera in my car in maine and the lcd screen cracked 
0	design i then realized a major design flaw 
0	functionality all the cameras functionality is only available when the screen is functional 
0	screen when the screen stops working youre out of luck 
1	manual mode i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure white balance flash 
0	viewfinder the viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken 
0	zoom the digital zoom is crap 
1	fits it fits in your pocket 
1	panorama setting the panorama setting is unbelieveable

0	price the price is more 
0	software i originally gave this camera stars when i had windows it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is sooo not compatible with xp 
0	drivers the new drivers on cannons site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software 
0	software the adobe software also was wonderful in but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application 
1	pictures but it takes gorgeous pictures for a mp camera 
1	camera i love this camera 
0	memory the only thing i dont like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card first thing 
1	price i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon 
1	camera i would recommend this camera unequivocally 
1	camera i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon 
1	camera i would recommend this camera unequivocally 
1	battery but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing great battery saver 
1	camera a great camera but here are some points which i dont notice in most of the reviews here which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer 
1	elph s i purchased the elph s mainly because i thought it was cool 
1	exposure prints the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great 
1	smaller resolution but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution i had to have the s 
1	s this is my second digital camera but im much more impressed with the canon s digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc 
1	light tiny this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me which is great considering im an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting 
1	software the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive 
1	software the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any degree panorama shots 
0	on camera controls my only complaint and the reason i gave it stars instead of is that the on camera controls arent as intuitive as they should be 
0	work ive often struggled to get something to work the way i want it and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time 
1	camera other than that i love this camera 
1	pictures color rendering the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect 
1	size metal case use picture quality software the good small size durable seeming metal case easy to use visually distinctive good picture quality fast usb connection mostly intuitive operation really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas 
1	size s if compact size is your highest priority in a megapixel camera the canon powershot s digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design 
1	image quality weighs the s s image quality rates in the middle of its class but it can still be a reasonable choice for students families or small businesses looking for an ultra portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack 
1	camera i purchased this camera before it went on sale and while i wouldnt have minded keeping the extra it was definitely worth it 
1	product i have been absolutely completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities 
1	product this is a great product and canon has done an excellent job 
1	jewel i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say iabsolutely love it 
1	usability performance expandability looks i give this product five stars for its usability performance expandability and definitely looks 
0	price i bought it new when it was cutting edge and very expensive 
1	camera software first i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software 
1	software the software has been installed on windows and xp and i havent had any problems with it 
1	camera performs picture battery the camera is solid performs well takes good pictures and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder 
0	pictures all that said i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera 
1	sharp color balance focus they are razor sharp the color balance is perfect and the focus is great 
0	pictures of people when taking pictures of people however it shows every flaw in the subjects skin 
0	pics other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better 
0	processing i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture 
1	camera i must say i think this is the coolest camera ive ever owned 
1	size first it really is tiny the size of a pack of cigarettes maybe a scooch deeper 
1	use second it is incredibly easy to use 
1	photos i just went on a quick photo shoot in nycs central park today and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took if i do say so myself 
1	use the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot and with instant review on the lcd screen you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot 
1	optical zoom cap the two times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly and lo and behold a two piece shutter like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off 
1	software i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc 
1	s at any rate if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back consider the canon s digital elph 
1	camera it really is the perfect travel camera plus it offers the convenience of digital photography 
0	why did i wait so long detail color rendition if youre looking for a digital camera to replace your big nikon or canon slr forget it film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical 
1	use images fits really like it easy to use great images very intuitive fits in my jacket pocket 
1	compact rugged use i was looking for a compact rugged camera which is easy to use 
1	memory expansion macro mode housing i wanted standard memory expansion macro mode and if possible a waterproof housing 
1	small even with the waterproof housing it is small 
1	lens the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you dont need to fuss with a lens cap 
1	housing the metal housing seems very rugged 
0	automatic modes id give it stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes 
0	auto mode for example in auto mode you cant use the flash redeye reduction you must be in manual mode for that 
0	auto color balance the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds 
0	dynamic range the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc 
1	macro mode the macro mode works well although it takes some practice since the camera doesnt clearly indicate when it cant focus 
1	lcd the white led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp even in sunlight and relatively easy on the battery 
1	panorama modes the panorama modes are wonderful 
1	small light its so small and light even with a spare battery you really can take it anywhere 
1	auto mode in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera

0	buttons buttons are little but if you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch you can deal with almost anything 
0	buttons buttons size is ok for me my wife but not my grany 
1	ease of use picture detail i was looking for something that wasnt too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detial 
1	size casing this camera is great wonderfully small and has attactive hi tech casing 
1	ease of use very easy to use for someone like me whos just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon 
1	controls ease of use the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use 
1	zoom the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective x zoom 
1	capacity this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory for example 
1	size so why the small digital elph rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality size because unless its small i wont cary it around 
1	size pictures after getting one for christmas from amazon im now a believer the digital elph is truly the worlds smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures 
1	pictures ive had this camera just over years and it takes pretty good pictures

1	size you willdefinitly appreciate the small size 
1	affordability while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability 
1	bang for the buck it is the most bang for the buck out there 
1	size weight navigational system sound like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound 
1	screen the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger now blue backlit screen which is infinitely better 
1	deal i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money 
1	wma file another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it 
1	software the software is great 
1	software transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy 
1	battery life even the battery life is great it advertises hours it is actually a little less but still good 
0	accessory only problem no accessories yet

1	sound the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s 
0	navigation navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well 
1	weight at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod 
1	battery leather case the battery is replaceable and there is a leather case 
1	software so far the software for the pc works easily 
1	looking by the way it looks nice also 
1	player it is worth it 
1	battery life price my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both 
1	control the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing 
1	scroll wheel the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad 
0	size it could be a little bit bigger but it is easy to get used to 
0	screen the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue 
0	firewire it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves 
1	leather pouch the included leather pouch is a big plus it actually protects the unit well something a lot of carrying cases fail to do with other audio devices 
1	battery construction size weight other plusses changable battery loads of presets for environments decent construction still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod 
1	size sound price overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod 
1	battery 
1	player price the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player 
1	player i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever 
1	menu the music is easy to get to and if you know how to search for an artist by name online then you can do the same with the zen 
1	screen the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long 
1	player use software sound all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound 
1	program it is a very intuitive program 
1	installation i had no problems following their installation instructions 
1	menu the menus are very easy to navigate 
0	scroll wheel the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks 
1	control the other controls are all very easy to use 
1	play option it has several play options one of the best is an option to shuffle based on all or a certain playlist 
0	playlist the only downside i see is that it does nt look like you can manage playlists from the nomad it has to be done from the computer 
1	price it also costs a lot less than the ipod 
1	earbud the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad 
1	earbud they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality 
1	deal this is a good deal for music and data storage 
0	software the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software 
0	software the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use 
0	player the player itself has all sorts of problems 
0	face plate the face plate which pops out for the battery pops open by itself every minutes or so 
0	file transfer the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset 
0	scroll the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others 
0	scroll depressing the scroll button is not always responsive 
0	scroll the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating 
1	sound on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured 
1	audio i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs 
0	player overall a very disappointing product 
0	setup interface the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par 
0	player the player is mechanics are also flawed 
0	player although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product 
1	price when it came down to it the price on this player is hard to beat 
0	scroll one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like 
1	this thing other than that this thing is great 
1	battery zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod 
1	battery the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance 
0	earphone software deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software 
1	nomad i love my new nomad its great 
1	price for some this might be a problem but for the price of a gig ipod you can get a gb nomad the ipod simply pales in comparison 
1	software the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds 
1	case the free carrying case is really protective and to me its the only accessory you need 
1	deal mp player but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad 
1	player best electronic i ve bought since i was born 
1	set up so easy to set up had some problems with my archos 
1	nomad explorer just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking by artist song title genre etc 
1	player look not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy 
1	design very sleek stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has 
1	leather case the leather case it comes with is pretty nice similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly 
1	button all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand 
1	sound quality the sound quality is also nice after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with 
1	sound option lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options 
1	navigation navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch 
1	navigation also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player 
1	screen saver oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet 
1	file limit another plus in my book no file limits 
1	playlist i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up 
1	storage i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder 
1	player i really have no complaints over this unit 
1	player i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player

0	manual also the instruction manual is very bad 
1	player i have no complaints with this mp player 
1	file transfer getting files onto it is quick and painless 
1	sorting then sorting the files is easy as pie 
1	storage and it holds sooooo much music and audio files 
1	player my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems 
1	battery the battery is nice 
1	screen the lcd screen was very large and readable 
1	player compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck 
1	zen i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class 
0	transfer transfering i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb or 
0	transfer it would only transfer or so songs and then come up with an error 
0	scroll wheel scroll button the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling 
0	size size bigger than the ipod 
0	software software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut 
1	sound quality sound quality was the same between the two but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features 
1	player i love this player 
0	player all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once but it has nt done it since 
1	player i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again 
1	software the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account 
1	player anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it 
0	size weight look folder structure first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture 
1	price way less expensive than the ipod 
1	interface i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx 
0	folder structure the cons are nt really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it is based on the title of the songs many of my songs where seperated into folders and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did nt have any that might be the same as another 
0	chinese name and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title 
1	transfer not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless 
1	xtra bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent 
1	storage i still have over gb left and already have over cd is on it 
1	interface software both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice 
1	transfer ripping transferring tunes is basic and pretty fast 
1	case people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection 
1	case it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to 
1	sound quality look screen battery the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod 
1	option you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well 
0	button the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing 
0	button my fast forward button works but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go 
1	button all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well 
1	support but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary 
0	size sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much 
1	size weight it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy 
1	product price bottom line great product unbeatable price 
0	id tag unlike my other mp players this thing will only work properly if you have id tags on all of your tracks 
0	id tag if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders 
1	player i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it 
1	setup transfer the setup and transfer process was cake for me 
0	transfer i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was nt a big problem 
0	explorer the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again 
0	player the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well 
1	player now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems 
1	screen the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it 
1	eax mode the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides 
0	jog dial the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do nt figure out a way to break it 
1	mp player all in all though i m very happy with my new mp player 
1	nomad i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic 
0	installation i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver 
1	software i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy 
1	playlist ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier 
1	mediasource i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer 
1	playback quality being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable 
1	sound when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra it is that good 
1	sound quality the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior 
1	nomad actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated 
1	finding finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy 
1	screen the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight 
1	use playback quality price i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use playback quality and value for the price 
1	player just bought one i ve enjoyed it to date 
1	size nice palm sized unit somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you re not going to try jog with it or something 
1	sound quality all reviews i ve seen seem to indicate that the creative mp jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these nd generation jukeboxed 
1	eax the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative 
0	player i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment 
0	control the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones 
0	fly wheel the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use 
0	button the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical 
0	software included creative software is pretty poor 
1	price great value gb vs gb ipod for the price 
1	sound best in class sound 
1	screen large easy readable screen 
0	play i tried to play the song three times with no success 
0	play it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk 
0	software had there been strange noises or obvious defects i would have accepted a replacement but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches 
1	player working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks 
1	player i love it 
0	player this product is too fragile for normal use 
1	software i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred 
0	software however the creative software is not real intuitive 
0	software the software is somewhat nice to look at using it is not the easiest 
0	rename if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly 
1	transfer transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 
1	sound it is great sounding even with the supplied earbuds 
1	earbud i must have differing preferences than others here as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony is that i thought sounded good on other players 
1	storage i love the storage in this thing 
0	warranty this is ridiculous 
0	scroll wheel the scroll wheel to be blunt sucks 
0	scroll wheel seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection 
0	interface the interface used could be better designed 
0	interface it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want 
0	case and the case how did this ever make it out of quality control 
0	case it is some protection for the unit but for useability forget it 
0	control the cut outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls especially the scroll wheel 
1	player despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc 
0	lock up however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times 
0	firmware quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time 
0	warranty i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous 
1	player this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product 
0	size weight the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more 
0	scroll the scroll button is nt the best as it sometimes can be hard to select 
1	sound quality first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod 
1	software the player is software is very easy to use and very good 
1	software compared to musicmatch the software has a better filing system and easier to use 
1	player to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod 
1	player this thing seriously is a good player though 
1	unit overall i like the unit 
0	player i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance 
1	price price gb of storage 
1	storage storage capacity 
1	battery user replaceable battery 
0	construction fragile 
0	scroll scroll button switch 
0	case the case hides the display you have to open it to see what you are doing 
1	player overall i like it 
1	storage the storage capacity is great 
1	price the price compared to the ipod is great 
1	price battery price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad 
0	itunes but for now it appears that this player does nt play well with itunes 
0	scroll the scroll bar is a bit of a pain 
1	software i ve had no problems with the software 
1	software i found it intuitive to use 
1	software this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem 
1	software the software comes with plenty of defaults genres 
1	sound the sound from the player is ok 
0	sound i was a little disappointed in the low end 
0	sound the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected 
1	this thing this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records 
1	storage one good thing it is gb of disk space 
1	price feature for the price and features it is really good 
0	navigation in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders 
0	navigation you even can not navigate by genre artist album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre no other division 
0	software the software which comes with player is not good at all 
0	nomad explorer i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work 
0	software so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly 
1	zen the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car 
1	battery life online music service pc compatibility longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities 
1	player i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it 
1	sound battery life price the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent 
1	style size control the nomad is not ugly it is not that big it comfortably fits in my pocket or heavy and the controls are not hard to get used to 
1	player so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing 
0	player this thing is trash 
0	construction a feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop 
0	screen b the screen is hard to read the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display 
0	scroll c the scroll bar is a travesty enough said 
0	software d software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up doesnt work with mp s the list goes on and on 
0	case e the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage 
0	look f it doesnt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course 
0	software the software failed repeatedly 
0	customer support website creative labs customer support website is useless 
0	software software downloads on the site crashed my pc 
1	player i just bought this player today and i already love it 
0	play it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd 
0	scroll another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on 
1	player otherwise this player is awesome 
1	screen it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily 
1	volume range the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want 
1	player overall this player is awesome and i definately recommend it 
1	this item i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards 
1	price naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable 
1	value compared to other leading hdd mp players the value per gb is the tops 
1	sound quality sound quality excellent everything you would expect from this company 
1	use the unit is easy to use and intuitive 
1	uploading uploading music is quick and easy 
1	software although the supplied software can be annoying at times on whole it is excellent 
1	player button the unit itself its well structured with just the buttons you need and none you do nt 
1	scroll as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible 
1	screen the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool 
1	feature there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization 
1	battery the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily 
1	battery life also the nomad is hours of battery life versus is handy 
1	equipment equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for 
0	case the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window 
1	headphone the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead 
1	player this player is an ideal purchase 
1	player i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player 
0	software on my main computer the software did not work right 
0	customer support i had to sit on the phone with customer support for hours and they did not help at all 
1	player i have the software working fine now and the mp player is fantastic 
1	player so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp player is worth the money it cost 
1	zx i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review 
1	size it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx 
1	sound quality the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod however it compromises a bit of the unit is size in doing so 
1	lcd the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did 
1	scroll wheel the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate 
1	sound the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product 
1	eax the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle 
0	enviromental audio the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it 
1	signal to noise ratio the signal to noise ratio is nice and high at decibles and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods 
1	software the software has nt been a hassle for me at all 
1	price lastly the price is fantastic 
1	software i uploaded the drivers and new software in minutes no crashes or problems 
1	usb usb very fast 
0	earbud yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap replace them 
1	sound but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers 
1	recharger and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world 
1	look size weight it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light 
1	scroll the scroll button seems ok i have no problems with it 
1	player i am very pleased so far 
1	use very simple to use 
0	battery a spare battery would have been great 
0	game no games it has a cool screen why not use it 
0	work it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer like some players 
1	use all in all suprisingly easy to use 
1	sound quality size price lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy 
1	sound excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox 
1	transfer transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad 
1	transfer i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer 
1	storage huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing 
1	transfer having usb makes for very fast transfers 
0	navigation navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs 
0	fm receiver fm receiver it has none 
0	construction cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners 
0	feel the player feels very delicate as if i m holding an actual hard drive 
0	feel as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable 
0	play the songs do nt play one after another like on a cd 
0	software software the software is crap 
1	rip cd i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of 
0	software otherwise it is difficult to figure out and awkward 
0	instruction even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out 
0	line out jack no line out jack as i said there is none 
0	line out jack it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack 
0	control controls are a bit awkward 
0	control it was nt as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman 
0	headphone crappy headphones 
0	earbud the included earbuds were uncomfortable 
0	navigation difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate 
0	navigation it is a bit cumbersome and i can t get to the songs i want as quickly 
0	navigation i think this is it is biggest flaw 
0	control up down left and right would have given me better control 
0	scroll wheel if you hold down the scroll wheel too long it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo nt stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it 
0	case it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack 
0	case as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand 
1	player overall i feel that it is a decent buy and am happy that i own it 
1	price for the price and size and features you can t beat the price 
1	button interface the buttons and interface are very easy to use 
1	click buttons display simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use 
0	software but the major problem i had was with the software 
0	instruction the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple 
0	sync the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful 
0	transfer i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused 
1	mp player with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod 
1	interface i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer 
1	product i have had no problem what so ever with this product 
1	software the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows k machine 
0	headphone the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity 
1	battery life the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs 
1	navigation took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo 
1	player i have nt messed with the firmware at all the player worked perfect for me right out of the box 
1	product all in all this is another excellent creative product 
1	size weight look display it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well 
1	product i would recommend this product to anyone 
1	player before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there 
1	software many people have written about the software being its one downfall personally i have nt had a single problem with the software i m running windows me 
1	cd rip the cd ripping to mp is so easy and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp player so it wo nt take up space on your pc hard drive 
1	software the software runs smooth it is nice to look at it is very organized easy to follow and makes things very simple 
1	control the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual 
1	player sound the player is fast and sounds great it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music or making it sound like you re hearing the music in a huge auditorium 
1	battery the battery lasts very long when playing music but writing files to the player drains the battery fast so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files 
1	playlist playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists 
1	software player the software could nt be better and the mp player works like a dream i could nt give this anything but a i wish there was a 
1	player it is an extremely cool gizmo 
0	playlist creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked 
0	sound quality my only significant complaint is sound quality 
0	eax the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq 
0	sound quality i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with bass boost 
1	product well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket 
1	product well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp player 
0	program well just one con its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it it will be a breeze 
1	price player not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have 
1	battery life it hasnt gone below the second notch so the battery life seems fine 
0	id tag my only complaint would be that you need id tags that takes a while to do if your mp files do nt have them 
1	transfer oh and file transfers are fast easy 
0	weight a little weighty but otherwise fine 
1	scroll wheel it is easy 
1	button the buttons are easy to use and its easy to navigate 
1	backlight the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see 
1	eax my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature 
1	eax its really cool 
1	sound quality sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse but its really good 
1	song speed you can also slow a song down speed it up which is cool too 
0	earbud but the earbuds suck 
0	case i forgot the case does nt fit 
0	case my case doesnt close maybe mine was just faulty but the case isnt that great 
1	storage also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy 
1	player hardware first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good 
0	software what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software 
0	bookmark bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player 
0	bookmakr rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made 
0	bookmark this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks 
0	playlist the dynamic playlists feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate 
1	price while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player 
1	nomad i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it 
1	storage capacity the storage capacity is great for me 
0	control the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price 
0	load loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well 
0	tag software my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software 
0	tag other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system 
0	software also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order 
0	playlist finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order 
1	product the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product 
1	software a lot of people complain about the creative software but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes 
1	sync first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer 
1	shuttle the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources you can t do this on the ipod 
1	sync second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer 
1	player the zen serves as a back up device as well as a player 
1	software third creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer 
0	cd burner only thing missing from creative is a cd burner 
1	creative for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages 
1	scroll zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player 
1	remove it also lets you remove songs from the play order 
1	delete if you bring up an album but absolutely hate some of the tracks the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order 
1	zen its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus 
1	this thing i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since 
0	control look the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are nt as easy as the ipod is or as sexy looking 
1	software the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered 
0	headphone as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away 
1	the unit the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road 
1	unit overall it is a great unit hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it 
1	size this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size 
1	case it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly 
0	cover the front cover feels flimsy but when snapped on the device still feels pretty solid 
1	software extremely convenient 
1	price great price 
1	software i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all 
0	scroll the scroll button is sort of annoying to push a nice button would be nicer but eh not a big deal 
0	size it is slightly larger than an ipod no doubt about it 
1	player i m really happy with this purchase 
0	size i would have liked to have given it stars docking that star only for the size 
1	screen equilizer now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and ive heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here 
1	case but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything 
1	price sound ive seen em all the archos dell ipods everything good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion 
0	weight size its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket 
0	playlist its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod 
0	battery life it also has unproven battery life 
0	software finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best 
1	price capacity price and capacity 
1	design interface slick looking design and improved interface 
1	battery removable battery 
0	case protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window 
0	scroll scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models 
0	eax eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp files 
0	volume does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers 
0	software software is absolutely terrible 
0	transfer will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles 
0	recognition does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library 
0	change too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks 
0	software you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best 
1	size despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box 
1	cd rip i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me 
1	transfter file transfers are fast nearly a song per second via usb 
0	software my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field 
1	sound to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player 
1	eax the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train 
0	navigation navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it 
1	player at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria 
1	this i got this for christmas and it is a great gift 
1	use i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful 
1	memory the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs my entire collection of cd is will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun 
1	battery sound plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad 
0	software case the only two things that stop me from giving it stars are the ho hum software that comes with the system and the traveling case it comes with 
1	rip quality ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good 
1	player considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player 
1	sound quality it is really a shame because otherwise creative mp players are very good and have the best sound quality of any players on the market 
1	zen xtra after some consideration i chose the gb nomad zen xtra from creative and i have not been disappointed 
1	battery first the battery is replacable by the user because creative intended it to be unlike apple with the ipod 
1	battery it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted 
1	software the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could nt be easier to use 
1	playlist cd rip you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player 
1	transfer and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy 
1	sound volume the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise 
1	earbud i thought i d have to buy a set of headphones to use with it but the included earbuds work quite well 
1	earbud they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department 
1	equalizer i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too 
0	clip however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off 
0	case also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display 
0	player software this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues 
1	storage i achieved my basic objective my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more 
1	stoppage the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation a slightly audible click if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do nt even notice the click 
0	software creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what 
0	mediasource mediasource did not recognize my tags 
0	eax despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax 
0	eax creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static 
0	mediasource mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws 
0	folder structure the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk 
0	storage in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection 
0	stop button the zen does not have a stop button 
0	manual but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version 
0	usb recharge the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge it does not charge by usb cable this is not tragic but usb recharging would be a convenient choice 
0	mediasource mediasource did not install on my personal notebook 
1	notmad m u files are used by most mp players like musicmatch and winamp but not creative without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists it does nt care what software you use to rip or catalog your music creative or any other company all my gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags hooray 
1	software given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software 
1	player now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it 
1	memory i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory 
1	sound quality the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes 
1	navigation it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device 
1	operate i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive 
0	software the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated 
1	napster one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software 
0	name they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name 
0	player i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason 
1	storage the memory is staggering 
1	musicmatch software i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit 
1	screen screen was good easy to read 
1	sound quality sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great 
0	software the software that came with it was tough to load 
0	battery top the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch 
0	top the top did not fit well into the unit 
0	cover the cover that came with it did nt fit very well

0	creative product i will never buy a creative product again 
0	thing i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing

1	wake up wake up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time 
1	play mode multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter

1	storage big storage my entire cd collection in one small device 
0	plug and play player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it

0	folder folders cannot be created for the audio files 
0	fm voice recording no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras 
0	accessory lack of good accessories this is more of an oversight of creative is marketing

0	software software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad 
0	player i am annoyed that the player is not automatically recognized as a hard drive 
0	player i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work 
1	product sound use i loved this product when i first got it great sound easy to use and held enough songs to suit any mood 
0	durability i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero 
0	hard drive always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped

0	id tag having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown 
0	nomad explorer with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software 
0	nomad explorer in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 
1	player my first impression was positive 
0	eax first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes 
0	menue control second the menu system and controls are poorly designed 
0	scroll the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well 
0	button the general button placement is not very user friendly 
0	case third the poor design continues with the case 
1	price overall a good buy for the price 
1	navigation easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton 
0	battery life my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of 
0	battery there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours 
0	lock up i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times 
0	construction the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case 
0	case at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice 
1	storage navigation playlist battery pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery 
0	battery life manual lock up replacement battery battery life is about of that advertised no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players occasional software lockups replacement battery is expensive 
0	construction support scroll wheel headphone jack creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack 
0	build what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off 
0	support feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products 
0	scroll wheel the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device 
0	software the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers 
0	headphone jack enough people have reported that their headphone jack does nt work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem 
0	folder the zen does nt support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders documents and programs can t be launched from the zen so it is not a hard disk it is a storage device at best 
1	sound quality reviews for sound quality are generally positive 
1	price sure this thing is definitely more cost effective than an ipod 
0	quality but with a low price comes lower quality 
1	sound quality battery life price our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price

1	battery removable and cheap battery a li battery usually works properly for years 
1	value value comparing data storage with price 
1	appearance the appearance is okayed 
1	size the size is small 
1	use easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this 
0	mediasource the software mediasource cannot work on my pc 
0	software in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place 
1	display the display is awesome you can see everything you want and read it clearly 
1	storage huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you

1	firmware the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any 
1	music the music plays awesome never skips even if u run for a bit so you can listen to music without interruption 
0	battery life the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with in this player is the battery life 
0	panel the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said 
0	transfer you need the software to actually transfer files 
0	player the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings

1	price and also it is priced very affordably 
1	storage with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more 
1	software the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair is notmad software because of some advanced features i wanted 
1	sound setting sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference 
1	accessing file accessing files by artist and album is easy and intuitive 
1	battery possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery 
1	battery since batteries do run out on everything this will also be a big money saver since ipods irivers rca dell all have built in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician 
1	value use try before you buy if at all possible although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface 
1	color i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy 
1	player i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it 
1	price price 
1	sound quality volume sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization 
0	earphone yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway 
1	interface i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough 
1	playlist i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer 
0	software creative software stinks 
0	cover the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day 
1	player have had the player since xmass and love it 
1	sound battery life battery storage screen firmware price great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price 
0	warranty freeze up navigation wheel short warranty occasional freeze up somewhat flimsy navigation wheel 
1	player this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod 
1	price for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some 
1	size design the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods 
1	build it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it 
1	control i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least 
1	scroll wheel the scroll wheel is better than the ipod is as well in that you do nt risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly just a small nudge of the finger and you re there 
1	screen the screen is large and easily read 
0	pop up face the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop off face that sometimes comes off a bit easily but besides that it is perfect 
1	sound sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod 
1	interface interface practically seamless 
1	id tag yet after ensuring that all the id tags are in order it actually turns out to be really handy 
1	playlist playlists can be generated on the fly or by using the software and there are a bevy of eq options 
0	balance the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance 
1	mediasource as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better 
1	mediasource it is easy to transfer preview and organize files 
1	id tag the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well 
1	software it was no problem for me to use their software 
1	player overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too 
1	equipment please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod 
0	player do nt buy this player 
0	player unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy 
0	player do nt buy this player 
0	product do not buy this product 
0	player i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy day warranty ended 
0	software the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb 
1	player honestly i love this player 
0	hard drive however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once 
1	break because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible 
0	player what a junk 
0	freeze every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes 
1	sound quality the sound quality is very good 
0	control software the controls are somewhat harder to use and there are some oddities about the software tagging system but most people can live with this 
1	storage having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific 
0	headphone jack typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others 
0	design i m convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed and will not hold up to normal use 
0	headphone jack the headphone jack seems to be a major problem 
0	front cover the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover which is taken off to have access to the battery seemed to come undone very easily 
0	headphone jack the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire 
0	lock up the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now 
0	hard drive in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class 
1	works works great no odor and uses regular bags 
1	diaper champ so far weve had no problems with the diaper champ at all 
1	diapers it contains the smell from our babys diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside 
1	odors refills i dont know if well run into trouble down the road with odors but so far i have no complaints and im very happy not to have to buy those refills 
1	diaper champ the diaper champ is the best we found 
1	bags there are no specail bags to deal with or buy 
1	bag we use the cheap gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around 
0	smelling now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will 
1	diaper we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it 
1	product it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and its fairly inexpensive as baby products go 
1	refills i love that you dont have to purchase expensive refills 
0	diaper wipes the cons at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth 
0	diaper champ in addition i dont believe that it is odorless

1	garbage bags it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills 
1	product it never smelled at all 
1	container the container is hard to open which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler and you do have to flip the handle carefully i dont consider these difficulties but features for the older baby 
0	size even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast 
0	size odor it seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless 
1	product this is a must have product for all new moms 
0	diaper genie the diaper genie needs its own refill bags in order to work and thats just more money that you dont have to spend 
1	work this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers 
0	item i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and cant tightly bundle it without a mess the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail 
0	fit my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesnt even fit a smaller sized garbage bag 
0	hole the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers and theyre on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un soiled they are 
1	fill unload it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie plus why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store 
1	diaper it also holds a lot more diapers 
1	size look at the size of it 
0	odor i have noticed an odor when unloading the diaper champ but at least you dont smell anything every time you use it 
1	diaper i highly recommend this

1	use its also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers 
1	champ the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle 
0	function but sometimes if the champ is too full the flip handle wont function 
0	diaper so i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper which i must remove usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full 
1	diaper pail i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it 
1	use the diaper champ couldnt be easier to use 
1	refills and the biggest plus is that you dont have to buy any expensive refills 
1	odor and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained which the diaper genie never did 
1	diaper champ if you are looking for a user friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained than the diaper champ is the one for you 
1	item use odor this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great 
1	diaper champ diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail 
1	holds it holds a lot of diapers not to mention the odor 
1	use its easy to use 
1	empty its also easy to empty out 
1	garbage bags and best of all no wasting money on special refill bags this takes ordinary garbage bags 
1	diaper pail whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers this is the truly the only diaper pail to get 
1	pail odor even though i never ventured into the cloth land i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life 
0	opening opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it 
1	refills being a very economical person i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills 
0	plunger as one other reviewer pointed out it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the plunger to get the diapers in the pail even though upon inspection the bag doesnt really look full 
1	emptying but from my experience by the time it gets to that point the bag is really heavy so i think this is kind of helpful its a built in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying 
1	gift this is a really great buy for yourself or as a shower gift 
1	champ go for the champ 
1	product i love this product 
1	dispose with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones 
1	trash bags plus the fact that it used regular trash bags is great 
1	refills no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require 
1	product and we still love it 
1	holds holds a lot of diapers a full week of toddler diapers 
1	trash bags we use our regular kitchen trash bags cheap 
1	odor holds the odor in nicely 
1	use easy one hand use impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail but that is rare and it usually just means that weve crammed too much in there and need to change the bag 
1	diaper champ we keep the diaper champ in our daughters nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers 
1	holds it holds quite a few diapers and pops them in quickly and easily 
1	trash bags i use the same store brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it no special diaper trash bags necessary

1	diaper champ the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into what diaper smell in less time than that 
1	purchases this is one of the best purchases we made 
1	product use effective great product easy to use economical effective absolutly fabulous 
1	champ update i knew that i loved the champ and useing the diaper genie at a friends house really reinforced that 
1	champ odor there is no comparison the chanp is easy and smell free the genie was difficult to use one handed and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isnt any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ 
1	pail i love this pail 
1	smell ease of use garbage bags no smell easy to use with one hand free and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you dont get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find 
0	diaper pail solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesnt really contain the smell 
0	diaper pail i still like it a lot and am not changing it for another but it is sort of stinky

0	odor but be prepared to buy something else which can trap the odor better 
1	diaper champ the diaper champ is the best

1	use the champ is easy to use 
1	champ with the champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid 
1	dispose it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers 
1	store bags the champ uses regular store bags 
1	champ you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ 
1	champ the champ is odor free for at least months 
1	champ the champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year

1	noise even did while daughter sleep and no noise 
1	smell i use the scented bags and even if i dont no smell 
1	space this holds alot and does not take up alot of space 
0	top loader we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used 
0	diaper champ we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only 
0	diaper wipes we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped 
1	diaper champ but like i stated its better then a trash can but im not sure if its better then the diaper genie 
1	diapers refills it holds almost a weeks worth of diapers and you dont need expensive refills any kitchen bags work 
1	smell at first i had a problem with some smell then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in then there is no smell at all 
1	diaper champ personally i am very pleased with the diaper champ 
1	operate it is mindless to operate 
1	diaper champ it doesnt stink ever 
1	clean and it is very easy to clean 
1	diaper i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time it is that simple 
1	diaper pail this is a great diaper pail 
1	use there is no odor and it is very easy to use 
1	refills also we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills 
1	diaper pail space and its the largest diaper pail ive seen without taking up more floor space 
1	champ and we definitely prefer our champ 
1	cost effective use capacity not only is it much more cost effective it is easier to use and clean and has a larger capacity 
0	unit it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full 
0	pluger the pluger gets stuck you have to manually extract the mess 
0	item i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got however i was not impressed 
0	diapers for one thing the diapers always get jammed in it 
0	product the product also leaves a faint smell in the room 
0	diaper champ all in all the diaper champ serves its purpose but it does not live up to its good reviews 
1	diaper champ i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags 
1	works it works great

0	clean you still have to clean the thing 
1	works simple and it works 
0	diaper champ also for those that complain that the diaper champ isnt as effective as time passes keep the following in mind as babies get older their diets changes and so does the smell of their diapers

1	pail this one is really great 
1	champ i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did 
1	champ well the champ has survived its first year with our son and it is great 
1	refills the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome 
1	work we just buy the smaller bags that come like to a roll and are sented and they are like and they work great 
1	bags we just recently had to buy another roll of bags so for a year of bags cant beat that 
1	change we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems 
1	diaper pail this is really a nice diaper pail 
1	diaper pail i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers 
1	diaper pail in fact i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now years old that i bought one for our new babys room 
1	diaper pail wow was that disappointing and we didnt even have it months before it broke 
1	diaper champ i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons

1	works works great 
1	price the price is right 
1	performed i purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the cmt people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed 
0	adjustment the adjustment knob seemed ok but when lowering the router i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob 
0	collet the collet for the inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out 
0	use then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit and i mean just barely 
1	price from the internet woodworking books local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m v hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price 
1	power speed but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large diameter bits 
1	power runs cuts the hitachi has plenty of power runs smooth and cuts effortlessly through maple 
0	bigger heavier use however it is much bigger bulkier and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand 
1	plunge since i use it in a table i dont use the plunge feature but if i ever need it ive got it 
0	use otherwise get a smaller single speed router which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits 
1	looked the hitachi is made in malasyia and looked cheap compared with the makita which is made in the usa 
0	worth if you think you are saving getting the hitachi you are right and you are also getting a router worth less than a makita 
0	pretty it aint cutting edge state of the art with all the latest bells whistles it definitely aint pretty 
1	smooth powerful affordable track record but it is smooth it is powerful it is affordable it has a proven track record 
0	adjustment i built my own router table with a tilt up top made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob these two things make it easy to change out raise or lower the bits 
1	costs router so for the money it costs for one of those top of the line models ive got a good router a nice table to put it in i like that 
1	router hitachis m v is a big beast of a router 
0	weight power precise its not the heaviest around but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation 
1	m v in my table the m v has been a real champ 
1	heavy speed the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it 
0	controls with the plungelift all my bit changing has been done above the table although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock 
1	motor start speed price nice things about the m v in a table the powerful hp motor is great soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on continuously variable speed control amazons price 
0	weight power spindle chuck not so nice things a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing the chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping 
1	router this is truly a clydesdale among the industry hp router workhorses 
1	solidity nimble used built like a tank yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig 
1	start the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation 
1	guide the edge guide is top quality easy to install and accurate 
1	speed this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit 
1	adjustment the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy but it works well and provides good accuracy 
0	collet the only complaint i have is that the collet will not sufficiently hold any of my bits 
0	collet the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately 
1	machine this is a great deal and im elated with my decision to go with hitachis green machine 
1	router wish i could give it stars 
1	adjustment collet i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too 
1	speed the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly 
1	guide the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well 
1	accessible the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing 
1	heavy stable it is heavy enough to make it stable but not too heavy to preclude hand use 
0	plunge the plunge action isnt smooth unless you make it so 
0	instructions the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rpms of the speed settings were mentioned 
0	fit finish also the fit and finish could be better although this doesnt detract from performance 
1	price overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase 
1	money this is an excellent router for the money 
0	plunge the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust 
0	springs i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much 
1	money other than that i think it is the best router for the money 
1	router i must have gotten a good one 
1	adjustment control collet i dont have problems with the depth adjustment the speed control the collet 
1	hitachi i would put the hitachi up with the best 
1	vibration no vibration 
1	plunging smooth plunging it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w lubricant 
1	router adjustment it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely 
1	shaft it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great 
1	balance lighter very good balance in the hands and lighter than most hp models 
1	start the soft start is nice 
1	price the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachis incentive 
1	price the total price with delivery was 
1	cheap less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer 
1	price saw the hitachi on amazon com with their coupon and could not resist trying it out 
1	operate unlike other reviewers i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table 
1	switch lock both the on off switch and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand 
1	heavy router it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried 
0	spring your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism 
0	spring mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it 
0	sawdust i have noted that as you use the tool sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention 
0	sawdust not a killer problem but not well done either 
1	use result for me it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high quality result 
1	price can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain 
1	m after getting used to the m all the rest seemed lacking 
1	router plunge on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable it is just a plunge router that works really well 
1	use i use it in the table in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances 
0	slop the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged 
0	big if it werent so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers 
1	router what an upgrade 
1	starts runs i have only used it with the collet and a round over bit but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly 
1	adjustment the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m v than it was on my old router 
1	use vibration the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration 
1	price combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box and im really happy 
1	router im sure i dont use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers but i really like it 
1	router i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot 
1	stable use visibility i find it very stable and comfortable to use it doesnt jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control and it has very good visibility to see your cut 
1	fence it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and wont break 
1	controls also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesnt have any extra knobs or gizmos 
1	simple i prefer things that are simple 
1	power control the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut and the speed control knob is easy to get to 
0	guide i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it 
0	springs i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise 
0	adjustments i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments but i seldom use it 
0	wrench i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table 
1	system its not a perfect system but its a very good one 
1	router ive owned this router for over years and am somewhat satisfied with it 
1	quiet power it is quiet and has plenty of power 
1	stability weight i find that it is stable in my hands and its weight actually contributes to that stability 
0	plunging that said i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism 
0	shafts shortly after i brought it the plunging shafts started sticking 
0	shafts after repeatly cleaning and recleaning it still stuck after using it for a little while 
0	plunge i no longer use it as a plunge router only as a stationary or table mounted router 
0	plunging if the plunging action is critical to your work look elsewhere 
1	performance features i love the performance and features of this router 
1	money for the money im not sure you can do better 
1	quiet adjustment speed its very quiet for a universal motor driven tool and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great 
1	plunging smooth plunging mechanism 
1	fence the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid 
0	grip chuck collet its oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router activate the chuck lock and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up 
1	router performer even with that i highly recommend this router outstanding performer 
1	router i purchased two of these beauties 
1	router i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router 
1	router one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for years without a problem 
1	collets the design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman routers i have previously purchased 
1	collets power they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered 
1	money i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper 
1	setup the setup works awesome as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for its merits and not just the company as a whole 
1	router i would however highly recommend the m v router 
1	hitachi m v im not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m v it turns out that now im very fond of it 
1	operation speed the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good jasada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results 
1	router its well made and user friendly 
1	router youll love it 
1	router it is currently permanently mounted in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot 
1	start runs this router has soft start and runs smooth and true 
1	router i use the router with a in raised panel bit with no problems 
1	power it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish 
1	price for the price i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup 
1	router you just cant go wrong with this one 
1	router enjoy 
1	price this is an excellent router for the price 
1	router the first one lasted about years of heavy use 
1	tool powerful this is a well made and powerful tool 
0	price i was some what sceptical when i seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible hp 
1	m v the m v has been great 
1	adjustment the height adjustment works well not perfect 
1	bog the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog 
1	quite workload cheap what i really like about its quite it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking 
0	router this router was a huge disapointment 
0	adjustment the depth adjustment was sloppy 
0	control the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool to effect any speed change 
0	control it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers 
0	control my son tried it and he too couldnt change the speed without an assist 
1	heft i did like the heft of the machine 
0	router control i sent it back as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective 
0	router all in all not very good 
1	power the power is incredible it cut through mdf and plywood like butter 
1	adjust the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well 
0	adjustment the only not so positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment it is not easy to micro adjust accurately 
1	price router i do not count this as a negative however because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up 
1	router the ones ive kept have proven their worth over the years however when i need a real workhorse i grab this router 
1	machine i recently had to run a straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didnt even slow down 
1	router i could take passes and it still didnt skip a beat 
1	hitachi ive yet to find the limitation for this hitachi and quite frankly i dont know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder 
1	price bottom line is that at this is an absolute steal 
1	router ive got a buddy whos trying to offload his almost new speedmatic because he saw what this router can do 
1	router it is without even a slight doubt my new favorite 
1	starts speeds depth power the hitachi m v is a dream to work with smooth starts adjustable speeds micro adjustable depth and plenty of power to spare 
1	router i couldnt believe what i had been missing 
1	router if youre looking for a hp plunge router the hitachi m v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget 
1	router ill be getting a second one for my router table 
1	power i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m v 
1	bog it doesnt bog down under load 
1	cuts cuts are easy and smooth 
1	works i use it on a router table and it is works well 
0	adjustment the major reasons i didnt give it a five are one i didnt think the fine adjustment worked well 
0	adjustment i replaced it with a router raizer and it works much better 
0	wrench two the single wrench just doesnt work well 
0	latch the sliding latch is does not stay in place 
1	router other than this i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again 
1	price i really liked the price 
1	control i like the speed control 
1	power it has plenty of power 
0	adustment knob the fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table 
0	router razier finally i gave up and i purchased a router razier 
0	wrench i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the sliding wrench which comes on the router 
1	router all in all i am pleased with the router 
1	power noise control the power low noise operation and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced 
0	heavy it it is a bit heavy for hand held work but any router this size will be 
0	control recenly the variable speed control went out 
0	control it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die 
0	plunge the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated 
1	router overall it is a great value 
1	price for the price i dont think you can beat it 
1	tool this is a fantastic tool to use 
0	heavy only problem is that is a bit heavy 
1	product this is a quality product not to be confused with teh cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china 
0	last they last about years until the problems start 
0	safety my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful 
1	router money when the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money 
0	safety luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case a finger 
0	depth once a depth is locked it will jump off a little while working 
0	depths you must keep double checking depths 
1	machine money but for the money it is a good machine 
0	duration well my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about years 
0	control the electronic speed control is not doing its job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will 
1	router for the hobbiest its probably a nice buy 
1	equipment for the person that uses the equipment every day pay the extra and get a reliable safer unit 
0	safety if this machine just stops on you unplug it quickly and get out of the way 
0	features there isnt much features on the ipod at all except games

1	bass treble the bass is deep and the treble is clear 
0	battery durability not good first problem if you havent seen the news recently the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised months 
0	replaceable battery also the batterys arent user replaceable 
0	flip side another thing you should know the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky and scratches very easily 
0	case also not liking the gel case 
0	features features really there arent any features unless you call the games a feature 
0	fm tuner there is no fm tuner while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen the iriver h gb the rio karma and the iaudio x have fm tuners 
0	voice recording there is also no voice recording something most if not all mp players have that the ipod doesnt 
0	photo viewing there is no photo viewing option however there is a gb photo ipod but it costs more 
1	use ease of use design the ipod is a very easy to use mp player and if you cant figure this out you shouldnt even own one 
0	itunes im probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software 
0	customer service customer service awful listen to this one remember the battery statement i made earlier 
0	technical service there technical service isnt helpful either they just read whats on their website and charge you to do it 
1	ipod the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company 
1	apple long live apple long live macs and long live the ipod 
1	ipod i have an ipod and it is a great buy 
1	sturdy very sturdy and strong 
0	games doesnt have alot of good games on it 
1	itunes the software with the ipod includes itunes which allows you to play the music on your computer rip cds onto your computer and move your music from the computer to the ipod 
1	click wheel this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch wheel for scrolling and click able buttons for selection 
1	song quality ear buds the song quality of the ipod is excellent and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory for most users 
0	scratches the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish and this surface is prone to scratches 
1	battery life battery life keeps improving on the ipod and a new ipod will give you up to twelve hours of play time per charge 
1	apple thank you apple you make fabulous products 
1	product the product i rate five stars 
0	service but i had to give you four because the service for my brand new ipod was terribly slow 
1	amazon plus if you order from amazon com they will exchange it for you no problem 
0	interface the interface took a little getting used to 
1	display this one has a color display which i like a lot being very visual 
1	photos i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and very importantly the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous 
1	sound the sound is just fine 
1	adapter it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall which i hear is a step up from the other ipods which require you plug it into a computer to charge it 
0	photo quality one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved 
1	hard drive affordable pros large hard drive for the gb and gb are both affordable 
1	screen decently sized screen one of the larger ones on the market at 
1	battery decent battery on the average size but the gb comes with a dock 
1	firewire usb firewire usb for those fortunate enough to have firewire your in for a real treat with autosync 
1	design great design very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied and now the wheel clicks taking away a lot of headaches from rd gen and very navigable in the menus 
1	sound durable compact good sound plays very nicely even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable not the most durable because its mostly plastic but very compact and sturdy 
1	games games not really important but existant 
1	hold hold button suprisingly not all mp s have this this allows you to have all the buttons unusable so that you dont accidently hit something in your pocket 
0	radio tuner cons no am fm radio tuner something a large number of competetors are doing 
0	voice recorder no voice recorder this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesnt have 
0	memory stick slots battery no memory stick slots although a rare feature it would be nice to have extra storage not that it needs it built in lithium battery a huge hassle to bring this back draining the battery once you get it helps but removable replaceable ones are a lot more convenient 
1	itunes itunes this is a love hate relationship program usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc but depending on your computer expertise this could be a difficult program to use and it is required for an ipod 
0	accessories no inbox accessories an arm strap belt strap case or anything would be nice but nope moveable parts this makes me almost want to keep my rd gen over a th with moveable parts its easy to damage an ipod at a gym so this is for more casual listeners note the ipod mini doesnt have moveable parts and is made of titanium 
1	overall comments overall this is still a great value but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market 
1	versatile versatile and stylish 
1	design capacity connection options itunes i had a casio unit which had given great service and would have been happy to get another one but was tempted by the ipods sleek design storage capacity connection options firewire and usb and its integration with itunes 
0	battery the battery issue is superficially a concern but any reasonable solder jockey can pop in a new one when the time comes 
1	controls the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed 
1	ipod the ipod is a very nice product which given reasonable care should give a lot of service 
0	ipod first let me say that i got the gb ipod for christmas and i most likely would not have spent the myself 
0	battery in addition i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours and it can take four hours for a full charge 
1	quality i have about gb used on my ipod so far and as far as i can tell all of them play at near cd quality 
1	interface use other than the fact that one cant delete a file directly from the ipod the interface is excellent and mind numbingly simple to use 
1	itunes as for itunes i dont find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp player but it is good enough 
1	ipod in conclusion i gave the ipod a because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly 
0	sensitive the ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily 
0	battery the battery does not last hours 
0	battery you cant change the battery so i dont know what im going to do in a year or so 
0	volume you cant turn the volume up very high but i think this might be for health reasons 
0	freezes my ipod freezes occasionally which is especially annoying when youre in the middle of a game of brick 
0	apple if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged they charge you roughly per minute and blame you for abusing your ipod

1	ipod everything i wanted the apple ipod has become one of the most sought after electronic gadgets and for good reason 
1	design capacity itunes its sleek design large memory capacity compatibility with itunes and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market 
1	capacity unless you have an enormous music audio book library the gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity with a stated ability to hold songs 
1	wheel backlighting itunes features click wheel to navigate ability to work with windows or mac optional backlighting ability to download pda info automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer 
1	equalizer theres even an equalizer that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic bass booster bass reducer classical dance deep and electronic

0	scratches the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage except the inevitable scratches 
1	apple apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment and surprisingly wasnt as expensive as its reputation normally holds 
0	apple apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napsters services 
1	battery battery non issue 
1	ipod use finally compare the ipod to other players on a cost gb and also consider ease of use 
1	ipod the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market 
1	purchase this is the best purchase ive made in a very long time

1	sound controls the sound quality is excellent accessing the music is easy and the controls are generally well thought out 
0	itunes as a windows user i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance 
1	ipod i still give the ipod five stars though as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install so ill give apple the benefit of the doubt 
1	battery the battery holds a charge for a very long time so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use 
0	outside finish my only complaint is that the outside finish of the ipod is rather delicate so i am going to get a case for mine so it doesnt get all scratched up 
1	quality of audio controls capacity i recommend this to any music lover anywhere the quality of the audio is excellent the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive and the storage capacity and battery life are huge 
1	itunes using the software itunes is relatively simple you just plug the usb cable in wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfered on over to the ipod 
1	amplifier and with the ipods full volume up all you have to do is adjust your receivers volume and your set since the ipod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its own 
0	proprietary if there were any complaints i have they are marginal but one is apples properietary set up for music files their incompatibility with other music services is down right wrong 
1	ipod however after purchasing a gb ipod its clear to see the superiority 
1	ipod interface design for a sleeker smaller and more average mp player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water the interface is great and the design is wonderful

1	battery the battery life lastes hours and charges quickly once youve downloaded your music you can access the tracks by artist genre album composer etc 
1	sound quality the sound quality is great 
1	earphones the included earphones are pretty good my advice 
1	use the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute 
1	hard drive with the ipod you can also store documents and contact files when its connected to your pc as an external hard drive 
1	games also included in the games section is the great music trivia option which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs 
1	storage space gb or gb the pros of the gb comes with a dock station and double storage space 
1	ipod capacity price overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast the capacity in the gb is more than i think most people would ever need and for the price i highly recommend it 
1	itunes design everything else about the ipod is great the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it 
1	finding finding all the albums songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have gig worth of music 
1	sounds it all sounds great too

1	store you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it 
0	battery because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unreplacable month battery 
0	batteries this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freakin easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries 
0	pay however in my mind is a lot to pay for a device that will only last months 
0	interface looks and durability i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface 
0	scratches the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousins player was relatively new it was riddled with scratches 
0	battery battery compared to the other players on the market the ipod has one of the worst batteries around 
1	ipod if like me you simply want an ipod to play your mp s buy this one 
1	reliability so reliability is the winner here for the ipod 
1	looks for looks well ipod is head and shoulders better both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod 
1	package the ipod package comes with everything you need the ac adaptor firewire cable those snazzy and powerfull headphones and of course the player 
0	design maybe this new design is more durable than the last but i kind of doubt it 
0	scratch we can start by losing the shiny miracle material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong and thus eliminate the need for third party iskin protective covers for an extra thirty bucks 
0	earbuds first of all ive never been big on earbuds theyre just not that comfortable 
1	ipod these issues aside the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one you cant be without one 
0	alternative and if youre a mac user like me theyve naturally made sure you have no viable alternative 
1	itunes also you have to use it with itunes or theyll sue dammit but itunes is about as good as anything 
1	player the player is great 
0	battery however the battery life isnt as good as i would like 
1	product overall this product is awesome

1	use i have transferred in about tracks so far very easy to use both the ipod and itunes

0	screen this is only a problem at night during the day the screen is very easy to see 
1	features i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it 
0	battery the only problem is the battery life 
0	battery apples ipod battery replacement service costs 
1	arm band the arm band is fantastic and it doesnt budge even at the gym 
1	design i love the slim design the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky 
1	sound the ear buds that come with it look cheap but the sound quality is amazing 
1	click wheel the click wheel is incredibly convenient however it can be a little overly touchy at times which will make you frustrated with your own fingers 
1	itunes i am a big fan of itunes simply because it is terribly fast and convenient if you are buying the songs from the itunes site 
1	apple way to go apple 
1	ipod i rarely get drawn in by mass commercialism but something about the ipod made me say in the words of lou and andy i want that one i was willing to shell out 
0	instruction unfortunately creative offered scant few pages of instruction which meant that i was on own from the outset 
0	touch pad navigate after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch pad system i could not get the unit to download my wma files 
0	explain so you might inquire why dont they make it a first priority to carefully simply explain how download music from your music library to their device this seems academic to me 
0	navigating most of us just want to plug and play not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing 
1	sound all of this said the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod 
1	bass highs the base was deeper and the highs were crisper 
0	touch pad instruction unfortunately the touch pad issues and poor instruction guide killed it 
1	machine what a kick butt mp machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source instead of paying for them two or three times then get the creative zen ipod killer kiss my ass itunes 
0	zen micro this one is particularly bothersome allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another 
0	software who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a foreign computer just to move over some simple files 
1	sound portability the sound is great the portability etc all the stuff you expect from a good mp player this zen micro has it 
0	button sensitivity button sensitivity even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting the buttons are far two sensitive really takes some getting use to and even then it is still too sensitive 
0	feature recharge cord worst feature possible this alone makes it rate one star whats up with no recharge cord 
0	cost you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost 
0	charged i took my zen micro with me over the weekend and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason to keep the zen micro charged 
0	product i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone 
0	prices creative inc the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices 
0	case the box included a little polyester pull string bag and tries to pass it off as the case 
0	case if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip on carrier for you zen micro expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time 
1	battery one outstanding positive feature is the battery it holds a charge for a long time longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup 
1	rechargeable battery creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature 
1	fm receiver the zen micro fm receiver is ok not great 
0	fm receiver iriver has a better fm receiver built in but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed 
1	constructed the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed hefty if you will far better than many of its competitors 
0	charges as i wrote this could have been a great product but expect hidden charges as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage

1	small upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp player 
1	installation the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software windows media player or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch 
0	touch pad the touch pad does take a little getting used to 
1	cable adapter headphones stand pouch the package also comes with a usb cable an ac adapter a pair of headphones a stand and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in

1	hardcase the hardcase they give with it must work well 
1	solid it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon 
1	sound sound im no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too 
1	sound i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright 
1	sound best of all the wmas sound great 
1	features utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list 
1	recorded the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal 
0	software software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it it does the job well 
1	playlists creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean 
0	battery life there are things that need fixing first is the battery life it will run for hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons 
0	usb second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the pc during play which is a bit irritating 
1	creative zen i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good 
0	headphone jack however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal every day use 
1	support the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges i had a new zen 
0	organization i dont especially like how music files are unstructured basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders 
1	sound the sound is quite good in terms of volume 
0	headphones the headphones are not very comfortable but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have 
1	installation touch pad i didnt have any installation problems and the touch pad is fine even if it is sort of inaccurate 
1	cheaper wma files i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes and the creative product was cheaper and i needed to be able to use wma files 
1	price all in all its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use 
0	software feature the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered and excludes my favorite feature in itunes the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder 
0	player nagatives of the player itself you need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player 
0	sensitivy even on the low sensitivy level a slight touch can skip or pause the track 
0	player this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing 
1	battery the battery is removable 
1	fm radio fm radio built in 
1	microphone record memos using the built in microphone

1	storage you can use it as a storage hard drive 
1	itunes i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro 
0	made first thing i noticed was that the creative wasnt well made 
0	player one drop from a pocket or desktop and itd be a goner 
0	sound problems with the sound quality were evident right away but even i couldnt imagine theyd be that bad 
0	eq bass the eq is awful and even at top volumes the bass is flat sounding 
0	volume cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality 
0	headphone jack the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sonys id been having 
0	sound if youve been listening to cds in your car for awhile dealing with the drop off in sound quality may take some getting used to 
1	car adapter however if there was one thing i liked about the creative it would be the car adapter 
0	storage even after all the nightmare sound problems id still half way like this product if it kept its promise the ability to store songs 
0	storage i got about loaded up before it told me i was full and at that point i was ready to toss it out the window 
0	creative my friend has an ipod and although the sound quality probably wont meet most audiophile standards the product itself is better than anything creative has made 
0	features it holds a promised amount of songs and the headphone jack volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than creatives 
0	player however this one makes an ipod sound like your old lps so even if youre a casual listener id advise that you avoid the purchase of this product terrible 
1	compatibility with windows media player while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini because i am not an apple person never has been i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player 
1	format also the wma compression format is superior to mp especially at lower bit rates so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers 
1	accessories i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories 
1	zen micro and so far i have been very very happy with my zen micro 
1	working its being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers

1	size feel the zen micro is smaller than it looks in pictures and feels very solid 
1	backlight the blue backlight is pretty cool 
1	screen touchpad the screen is clear and readable and the touch pad works very well it took me less than a day to get the hang of it and now i like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control 
1	sound audio quality great sound i was very impressed i encode at kbps and the audio quality is great especially with the better headphones 
1	transfer sync with media player the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast 
1	battery replaceable battery 
1	interface with the right firmware drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive 
1	player i have not yet used all the features like the calendar etc but as a music player this little thing rocks 
0	battery life the only reason for not giving it stars the claimed battery life of hours is very optimistic possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for hours without ever touching the player but in real life i can probably get hours at most 
0	battery life even the shorter battery life though has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way 
1	warranty price accessories player if you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty this is the player to get highly recommended

0	battery life the battery life leaves a lot to be desired 
0	firmware i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem but it hasnt worked 
0	outlook sync the outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people several people complained about the touchpad and frankly im starting to see why 
0	touchpad i occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly 
0	audible com book compatibility not compatible with audible com books 
0	zen micro overall it does its basic function very well but we expect more from the mp players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occassion 
1	player dont worry this player rocks 
1	appeal it was also the most appealing 
1	packing for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out well presented and easy to open and put back together 
1	casing it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside 
1	case a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering 
1	design i do give create to creative for their attractive design 
1	functionality creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices 
1	player creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device 
1	player it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk 
1	quality everything shines of quality 
1	player i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad

1	player so far i have no complaints with this player

1	battery charging another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable 
1	fm tuner fm tuner microphone having a tuner in the player is a blessing 
0	fm reception since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works 
1	microphone builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes 
1	sound sound this is where i love zen the most 
1	sound excellent sound i mean the player has juice 
1	bass treble the bass treble the sound detail is awsome

0	belt clip design i dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely 
0	headphones beltclip design what i dont like nothing much except headphones belt clip design 
1	sound fm transmitter to use zen with your car sterio fm tunner latest find connected this baby to my audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod 
1	player thankfully creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place 
1	zen micro while i have not had the privilege as many call it of owning an ipod based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones 
1	player by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch 
1	zen micro while im not too keen on their customer service i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth 
1	look size battery life about the product the zen micro is a sleek stylish device that caters not just to hip youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life size or the awkward factor 
1	size design it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well designed doesnt look to ostentatious while im walking around with it 
1	interface the interface while a bit confusing at first is very easy to navigate after about minutes 
1	battery life battery life is exceptional lasting longer than the hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market 
1	file transfer software transferring files couldnt be easier thanks to the included software bundle 
1	organizer software also i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software which i had with audigy zs sound card originally it is definitely an added plus 
1	design features all in all creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features and i look forward to the nomad zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype 
0	configuration p s the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power after connecting it to the rear ports it works perfectly 
0	player the ipod mini is smaller and sexier albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value 
0	storage format the karma is only more its small had a gig drive and supports more formats including ogg 
1	functioning initially i was very impressed after loading songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright 
0	auto load after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didnt do anything but turn on my player 
0	software it seems like the software is just not responding 
0	support the support has been less than impressive considering the cost 
0	support im going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through a refund should be twice as frustrating 
1	storage battery features the extra gb of hardrive space removeable battery and fm tuner as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me 
1	working fortunately for me i have yet to have a single problem with this player 
1	interface controls i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although ill admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so 
1	manual however there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro 
0	software while the software may not be as easy as i tunes it is not difficult to use by any stretch 
1	loading speed as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player the songs load extremely fast about one or two seconds per song 
1	editing titles i also like the fact that you can edit your mp titles etc 
1	sound after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md e lps and sennheiser mx s i find myself still using the creatives which in my opinion sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord 
0	fm reception if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway so you can take that for what its worth 
1	zen micro overall im very pleased with the zen micro and based on my experience with it can recommend it without reservation 
0	functioning it had issues right off the bat with freezing up staying in ishutting down mode and just not functioning very well in general 
0	touch pad access the touch pad would be a great thing if it worked well and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player i did have problems accessing them from the player 
0	make many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well 
0	player it is the first generation of the player and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck 
0	player if someone asked me flat out id say to go woth something else 
1	price design perhaps i bought the micro to be different the cheaper price tag the design or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways 
1	player whichever it may be im happy ive made this purchase 
1	size when i opened the box i was shocked by the size of this thing its tiny 
1	look size its shorter sleeker more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy 
1	interface trim the interface has a sassier flair and the blue lit trimming is an added bonus 
1	sound moving on to sound department it delivers 
0	earbuds ive since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable but are too similar to ipods and can target ipod theives here in nyc 
0	design although i thought it couldve been designed a bit better 
1	extra features there are extra features packed inside this unit such as fm radio tuner voice recorder calendar and alarm clock 
1	battery usage speaking of battery its removable and replaceable 
1	micro overall the micro is a solid device and i havent fell into a problem with it yet knocks on wood 
0	storage its perfect for those who arent planning on storing tons of music 
1	music transfer transferring music is a breeze i dont subscribe to music services but as mentioned on other reviews micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes 
1	features sound quality it may not top the ipod mini but its definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality 
1	design size comfort look strong points design small comfortable curved and stylish 
1	variety of colours colors variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from 
1	sound you dont need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a special edition to get black sound awesome batteries removable replaceable 
1	audio formats audio formats supports both mp wma and yeah wav too 
0	touch pad design volume control weak points touch pad design could be better volume control controlled through the vertical strip but purchasing a headphone with built in volume control will do the trick 
0	fm reception radio quality weak reception 
0	color touchpad the colors are a joke and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad 
0	design but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design 
0	software still has terrible software 
0	software you have to wonder why creative cant get this right 
1	storage you do get more gb than an ipod mini 
0	screen review screen review could be better 
0	screen review apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a gig mini 
1	player this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price 
1	storage cost the g ipod costs the same as this g zen micro 
1	features it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately 
1	design creative did an awesome job with the design 
1	headphones extra accessories the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it that i know doesnt come with every one 
1	player i have the black one and adore it 
1	look background light it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black 
0	touchpad the touch buttons do take a little getting used to and i dont like how the scroll button is the same button used as an enter key but you get used to it and it isnt a big deal 
1	size style i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini 
1	player overall ive been very impressed with the player 
1	functioning ive had almost no problems with the firmware but i have kept the player up to date 
1	firmware im not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li ion battery the better firmware or a combination of both factors 
1	battery life i imagine if i left my player untouched it could play for considerably more than hours at a low volume level 
1	sync to windows media player one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player 
1	speed look its just as fast as the included creative software but much less invasive and overall better looking 
1	touchpad the touchpad is great once you get used to it and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels 
1	touchpad also the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree 
0	fm reception the fm radios reception isnt spectacular but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area 
1	radio record its ability to record radio is useful as well but would have been moreso if it could be preset 
1	look feel sound the player looks great feels great and sounds great 
1	durability so far it has been very durable but those arent really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own 
1	earbuds they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonics and sennheisers 
1	built ive dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces and it still works flawlessly 
1	zen micro this year it seems that i choose my timing perfectly having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro 
1	features everything that i have listed above the zen has and more 
1	navigation the menus are easy to scroll through they are laid out naturally and make sense 
1	interface the computer interface is good only losing points due to the fact that creative branding is all over the place within it 
1	transfer speed battery life songs transfer lightning fast and the two batteries that came in my box give me hours of listen time 
1	features on the fly play list creation address book removable storage drive capabilities sound recorder the list goes on people this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies it was like halloween all over again 
1	design ease ofuse so far i have used all of the above mentioned features and find them well designed and easy to understand 
0	zen good though and the zen does have a few drawbacks 
0	file transfer while transferring songs to the player the interface has crashed a few times normally this would cause me major concern but it appears that this bug is reproducible which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly 
0	response speed another thing i dont like is that some of the features take seconds to load up 
1	plaeyr thats it for now what are you doing still reading this click the add to cart button already 
1	features sound quality music source support right out of the box i loved it better features than the ipod great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use 
1	player so i was one who was ready to give it stars with no complaints at all 
0	warranty after consulting with creatives customer support they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair which would cost me since its past the day warranty 
0	working well i got my second player and right out of the box it wasnt working right and once again after consulting customer se 
0	quality reliability they obviously have quality and reliability problems 
0	player they have a good concept here and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative so maybe they will do better with the next gen version but for now i say buyer beware 
1	player original review december im sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro but mine has worked great 
1	player this is my first mp player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do 
1	sound rip i have ripped over songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast and they all sound great 
0	interface es the interface took a little getting used to but once i did its almost second nature now 
1	organization i love that you can create custom playlists and organize music in so many different ways 
0	wav format only slight negatives ive had so far is that i havent been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet 
0	case my other nit is that it didnt include at least some kind of carrying case for everything 
0	belt clip yes there is a belt clip but that doesnt hold the extra battery and usb cable 
0	bag the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless 
0	bag it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart 
1	player i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it 
0	player it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it 
1	features the fm tuner the g of storage and the removable disk are all great features 
0	interface on the downside i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software 
0	software is not as intuitive as i would like 
0	earbuds also the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable so i bought a pair of over the ear headphones 
1	player overall i am very pleased with it 
1	player the more i use it and figure out how to do things the more i like it 
1	sound quality before you run out and buy an ipod understand something there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle principally excellent sound quality 
1	headphones the supplied headphones are hands down better than the mediocre ipod buds 
1	size the player is smaller than you think 
0	touchpad the touch pad is over sensitive and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive 
1	sound quality music subscription service bottom line if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services and are willing to deal with the possibility of setup gremlins by all means get the zen micro 
0	software the machine itself seems fine but the software that came with it is awful 
0	player after installation the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions it totally shorted out 
0	working i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work to no avail 
0	customer support of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative through their website and by the time they finally got back to me several working days later when they promise only one their suggestions were completely worthless 
0	player his is what i get for my on this mp player 
1	zen micro the zen micro is near perfect 
1	built its still alive still kicking and still playing 
1	windows compatibility the zen micro has a lot going for it 
1	size sound quality interface look battery features it fits into a hand well it has a removable battery great sound quality fm stereo recorder smooth ui and a feature that most unipods lack char 
0	work with wmp it wouldnt always work seemlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it 
1	accessories the accesories that come with the player are great 
1	bag white earbuds a case a stand a clip and a nice little zen micro bag 
1	player best in class 
1	player it gives you the most bang for your buck period 
1	quality creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and yes charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie 
1	player pick your favorite color and buy it 
0	touch sensitivity as for the zen micro cons i read that every button is touch sensitive and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front 
0	durability putting the micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything second im worried about the durability of the player 
0	durability after research of other creative hard drive players i found that most of them arent very durable and tend to crash 
0	price last i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this 
1	design color pros the design is very nice and the colors are too 
1	features it also has tons more features then previous creative products and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want not the default items 
1	battery the battery is also convenient but could have been better such as the zen touchs battery 
0	storage verdict had i not needed something with a tad bit more space i consider this player fair game 
1	player if you dont mind all the buttons being touch sensitive id recomment buying it to try out and also buy an extra year warrenty for it 
1	player anyway my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing 
1	firmware the program is called gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does 
1	look size accessories looks snazzy smaller than a pack of smokes easily transported ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter usb cable 
1	battery life sound quality battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet awesome sound quality i mean it is creative right 
1	navigation sorts music by artist album genre etc its easy to wade through gigs of tunes to find what youre looking for 
0	scrollpad it does take some getting used to 
0	charging whatever on to the negatives touchy about charging you can damage the battery and seriously decrease its life if you dont upgrade the firmware or dont heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side 
0	button functioning it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working 
0	users guide users guide doesnt cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website 
0	heat cant be left in the car it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long 
1	size but since its so small it isnt a big deal to bring it with me 
1	player overall though im very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp player even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod 
1	napster go compatibility i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster go which is a subscription service allowing me to download as much music as i want for a flat fee 
1	player and i must say this mp is very cool 
1	look its so cute and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue 
1	installation after installation which was very simple i downloaded any updated software from the creative website before i downloaded any music 
1	sound the sound is very nice 
1	lock feature i also like the lock feature so it makes the touch pad inactive 
0	fm reception i tried to use the fm radio option but it doesnt seem to really pick up the stations i listen however i am going to try it in a different location it may have just been my residential location 
0	touchpad even when i set it to low its still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do 
1	player otherwise i am extremely please with the creative zen micro gb mp player 
1	zen micro however after playing with it for three weeks now im convinced the zen micro is superior 
1	sound quality i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality with no need to upgrade the earphones 
1	fm tuner i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill concerts and programs being simulcast npr and on and on 
0	scroll bar ive read about the issues with the scroll bar but they must have taken care of that now 
1	ease of usage mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download 
1	size look its also smaller and gets more looks 
1	extra features an extra gig of room fm radio voice recorder pim applications with sync to outlook 
1	player this is really a no brainer 
1	buy the zen 
1	features i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features extra g storage wma support replaceable battery and especially that it wasnt an apple product with their proprietary architecture 
0	touchpad the touchpad is virtually unusable sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you dont want 
0	download speed another problem is that the latest firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player which seems to be very very slow for downloads charging also note that it doesnt seem to charge when connected to the pc only when plugged into an ac socket even though they both connect to the single usb port on the player so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music 
1	outlook compatibility better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility 
1	software tech support accessories creative has excellent music software a very responsive tech support group and usually a good array of accessories 
1	additional accesories the zen micro is no exception in addition to the case it comes with a neck strap and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging 
1	player if i could id trade up on my creative muvo and snag a zen micro tomorrow 
1	player portability size this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks 
1	plug in i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the stores sound system 
1	features headphones feature for feature i find it a very sweet little player equipped with a higher end headphone system between this and th larger zen ihardly use my home stereo system anymore 
0	napster to go compatibility if you buying this player to use with napster to go wait a while 
0	firmware a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it 
1	player on the whole im quite happy with the purchase 
1	sound storage the sound is bright and clear the ability to store any mp s is great and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time 
1	look comfort weight interface the device looks very cool i think its comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice 
1	srorage no offense to amazon but i was able to find one online for just over bucks and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space 
1	radio feature i like some local stations stern and npr and so the radio seemed like a great option 
0	fm reception imagine my disappointment though when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega strongest fm signals in my area 
0	fm reception it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound 
0	battery life the battery as others have said also seems weaker than creative suggests 
0	creative still thats enough time that im still satisfied if a bit grouchy with creatives overhyped promises 
1	headphones have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility 
1	player as i said i dont regret the purchase at all 
1	zen micro eball metaphor i was hoping creative hit a home run here and i think the zen micro is more like a stand up double 
0	player respectable solid but not awe inspiring 
1	sound quality battery life capacity look construction price compatibility actually the creative zen micro solves all that 
1	sound quality sound quality phenomenal 
1	sound quality earbuds unarguably better than apples and nice earbuds to boot 
1	variety of colors your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package 
1	storage five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums 
1	construction tough as nails 
1	construction no skips and it hasnt faltered once despite your inevitable drop or two 
1	compatibility flawless 
1	play wma no locked in proprietary business like apple this baby plays wmas too 
1	voice record player the voice recorder is a beautiful add on not even necessary but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player 
1	sound gets nice sound too 
1	fm tuner the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake 
1	player in conclusion this player is beautiful 
1	ease of use power power for the tech savvy ease of use for the less fortunate 
1	player but it you wont regret it 
1	player functioning touchpad this player is absolutely phenomenal i havent had any problems and if youre worried you will have problems i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways i find the touch pad very easy to use and im surprised so many people have had problems 
1	sound quality the sound quality is superb much better than that of an ipod in my opinion 
1	radio the radio works excellent in my area im not sure everywhere else 
1	software file transfer speed the software is very easy to use and the transfer is super fast 
1	battery dj features im not gonna go into the features cause if youre reading this review youve probably already looked at them but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus 
1	look the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also 
1	price player t simply the best player on the market for a really low price so why look anywhere else 
1	player ive had it for about a week now and have to say its one of the best purchases ive ever made 
1	look ease of use sound quality its a great looking easy to use device but its the sound quality which is truly amazing far better than my sony mini disc player 
1	interface touchpad i have no problems with the touch pad and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual 
1	media player compatibility why bother when it works perfectly with media player 
0	battery life where close to hours but at least it is replaceable 
0	battery life i would give it about or hours although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles 
1	storage the extra gb is just a bonus 
0	headphones the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of ear buds 
1	sound if your looking for a great sounding mini player you cant go wrong with the zen micro 
0	player unfortunately i was wrong 
0	player within one month my player completely died 
0	touchpad buttons this time the touch screen wouldnt respond to me and none of the buttons worked 
0	working so i took out the battery and put it back in again only to find that it would not work 
0	sound i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling humming buzzing sound while music was played 
0	customer service i sent creative customer service emails in which they did not help me one bit and dont seem to even want to help 
1	design it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design 
0	player its too bad though that 
1	zen micro the creative zen micro at first glance is a dream come true for all mp and music lovers 
1	battery the zen offered a great alternative 
1	software its easy to use and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch 
1	sound quality the clarity is unbelievable which means you can cram almost the full 
1	sound quality other mp players wont give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level so i imagine they wont at lower ones either 
0	headphones the included headphones suck so get your own 
1	trnasfer transfering mp s are a cinch with the included software 
1	format the zen plays mp wma and wave formats which makes it more versatile than the ipod 
1	software the greatest thing about the software is that it reads your cd info 
1	organization track name artist album and genre is automatically retrieved via internet labeled and properly catergorized into the zen 
1	labling rks almost without fail no matter what your taste in music is from relaxation music to hard rock to hip hop to korean and japanese to afro cuban and salsa jazz blues country and pop this feature performs well 
0	touch screen the touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to but once you do and while the zen is still alive its a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies 
0	fm reception just too numerous to list fm radio which has weak reception but at least it there and a microphone to name just two 
1	touchpad light oh and another is the cool halo light that surrounds the touch pad and lights up when you touch the screen and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer 
0	design but the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw and im going to tell you what it is but first two more things about this piece of garbage thats so great and couldve made it a potenial ipod killer 
1	size storage one its size its smaller than the ipod mini and holds more music 
1	battery two it has a removeable rechargeable battery so you dont have to send the thing in when the re 
0	design but all of this means nothing because of the serious serious stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw after months give or take a few weeks you wont be able to hear anything 
0	headphone jack design because the engineers at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack 
0	headphone jack again the headphone jack on this thing is garbage 
0	headphone design again this is a design flaw in the headphone 
0	zen the flaw is inside the zen 
0	headphone jack the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to 
0	zen micro the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer not an ipod killer 
0	storage why would anyone buy this when you can get a gb ipod that will hold times the number of songs for the same price 
1	audio quality ease of use features this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality ease of use and features 
0	usage with subscription service to use the creative zen player with a subscription service you need to go to creatives web site and download new software for your pc 
0	set up i havent seen any problems yet but if you dont like to tinker a bit this player can be a little challenging to set up 
0	transfer speed right now the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly 
0	subscription wma this doesnt affect standard mp files just subscription wma files 
0	transfer speed the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer but its only by about or so 
0	subscription drm encoded again this doesnt affect regular mp files just subscription drm encoded files like those from napster to go or yahoo music unlimited 
1	player otherwise this is a great alternative mp player for those of use who dont want to worship the mighty all powerful apple 
1	player i got it to use with the new per month service from yahoo and despite the above issues i love it 
1	creative i have owned some kind of creative audio product since and have never had to call tech support 
1	player the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily 
1	interface storage battery life it beats apple on the storage space it beats apple on the removable battery and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel 
1	audio quality further the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod 
1	player i have had several mp players over the past few years and have to say that this by far is the best that ive owned 
1	features however the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the zen micro has to offer 
1	storage battery life extra features some features that the zen micro has that sold me on my purchase include a g hard drive actually an sd flash card drive very large and much more than actually needed the ability to sync with microsoft outlooks calendar the long battery life of about to hours i can change the battery myself for about to buy vs 
1	construction sound quality microphone sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about the ability to record with a built in microphone very sturdy construction and not to mention the sound quality is excellent 
1	user interface as far as user interface is concerned the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player creative mediasource organizer 
1	converter this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another 
1	formats these include mp wave wma wma pro and wma lossless it is very user friendly simply by right clicking the file to be converted 
1	creative zen micro by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money if you are undecided the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice 
0	on off i dont know maybe i got a defective one but first the player would not shut off next the player would not come on i had to send it away to get repaired 
0	ear phone jack now the players ear phone jack is not working i have to send it away again 
1	player when its working its great but it is very tempermental

1	phone this phone is highly recommended otherwise 
1	phone nokia makes a great phone that is clear 
1	menu feature with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great 
0	menu the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have 
0	internet the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network

1	design screen the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution

0	priced i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time 
1	phone i must add to the dismay delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held 
1	use it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight 
1	keypad the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer 
1	keypad believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the has the best keypad 
1	look i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be 
1	interface the nokia has a brilliant java interface 
1	mmc card the phone offers a mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature 
1	capacity capacity is not a problem here 
1	build the build is just right 
1	sturdy the phone is sturdy 
1	build ive dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever 
1	phone its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it 
1	phone this isnt the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this are you

0	upgrade you can upgrade but then theres a certain level of trouble involved 
1	phone this makes for a great phone 
0	phone ive had nokias for years and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use a phone 
0	phone on the plus side its packed with features including bluetooth that works fine its really a tiny computer that is also a phone and thats the negative 
0	screen as a computer or pda its weak since the screen while large by phone standards is still tiny to really do anything on 
0	dial when you dial a number youll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct 
0	keys youll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once 
0	screen i hope you have a magnifying glass because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny 
0	screen its as though nokia has segregated of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just for the day to day use 
0	phone ive have many nokias and while this is the best for features its the worst as a phone 
0	phone my old siemens s on the other hand worked beautifully with all of the above 
0	camera who in the hell needs a frigging vga camera on their cellphone 
1	phone since then i have not found one major problem with it 
1	camera pda i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and or lots of features you would find in a pda 
1	bluetooth transfer i own this phone for about months now i have used the following features bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook transfer files i have many movies on it now with a mb memory card that it takes 
1	handsfree handsfree future is good but not too exciting 
0	slow bluetooth only thing i dont like about it is slow in changing apps boot up and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth 
1	looking this one has a good looking 
1	look its oval and nice 
1	shape keypad joystick i like its shape and its keypad and joystick 
1	use small its easy to use not too small and not too big 
1	screen the screen is quite big but the just about color 
0	camera and other else the camera is still vga 
0	slow i must say this one is quite slow to open an application 
0	phone sometimes it needs few minutes to open an application 
1	phone few month ago its very popular among my community 
1	phone its good 
0	phone but not good enough for me 
1	color ok score oh yes the newest color of this phone is quite cool 
0	nokia i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones 
1	while this phone obviously doesnt have the same quality construction as motorola does the nokia is one of the better phones ive used 
1	versatility features what makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has 
1	audio quality great audio quality overall 
1	audio quality handset quality is great as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality 
1	camera a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures movies and having general all around fun with 
1	joystick the joystick design they are using on the new nokias gives you a great degree of control 
0	joystick the only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming 
1	ring tone game one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices 
1	nokia if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday nokia beats everyone else 
1	bluetooth bluetooth wireless technology so that i can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables 
1	wide the phone is really wide which seems to be a turnoff for many people but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic 
1	small i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others which are actually starting to get too small 
0	construction my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices but they also dont last as long 
1	construction i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorolas do but as long as im not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine 
1	phone other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely wont disappoint any already established nokia phone fans 
0	interface operation its like bmws i drive it does its job but has the most unintuitive overly layered interface 
0	operation the phone must be shut down taken apart to change the memory card and turning the phone back on takes a little while 
0	instruction booklet even the instruction booklet is out of order 
1	applications applications it has lots of applications and they work very well when you eventually find where they are and they finally open 
0	applications no matter how accustomed to the phone you become too much time is required to get to open and close applications 
1	the has more ameneties than most world phone camera video speaker bluetooth infrared modem for computers electronic wallet internet access calendar calculator converter and more 
0	phone the phone does not have an mp player fm radio k color screen megapixel camera quad band pda photo editor 
1	dependability dependability ive seen no glitches 
1	phone ive had no problems w this phone 
0	keys styling ergonomics the keys are small which generally doesnt bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little braille but the keys run into each other so careful attn must be paid when dialing 
0	stylized its not as stylized as a sony or samsung 
1	big although it has chubby hips the device isnt really so big 
1	screen solid squeak free large screen 
1	memory memory storage seemingly boundless 
1	memory first of all the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos sound clips photos texts etc 
1	transmission secondly all info can be sent to a computer and w o the hassle of usb wires 
1	mhz the is the true world phone in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe including new zealand and australia whereas the replaces it w mhz 
1	coverage the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries excluding new zealand and australia 
0	service the will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas 
1	as the uses mhz it operates in more countries than the 
1	battery life the battery life is less than stellar but it charges w the quickness 
1	operating system remember this phone uses an operating system symbian and its feature rich w k colors 
1	video it films second video for crying out loud 
0	battery life the battery life cant be very long lets not be greedy 
0	game dont use them so i delete them for addtl space 
1	downloads there are number of downloads needed available for this phone they will be texted to you at no cost 
1	phone a sony ericcson may be the phone for you but good luck finding one w all the features such a competitive price 
1	phone despite a critical start this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do does more than most does it well is dependable 
0	phone when you consider expandability the numerous features two transmission programs and multiple storage devices dependability this is a phone that isnt easy to out grow 
0	bluetooth bluetooth does not work on this phone 
0	bluetooth though nearly a dozen different people at both t mobile and nokia have told me otherwise it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices 
0	phone only then did i learn the truth this phone does not work with palm pdas 
0	nokia this simple nuance was too much for nokia and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free 
0	nokia in short nokia themselves dont know that this phone doesnt work with the palm and if you dont heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly 
0	nokia ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved 
0	photos the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too they look as though they were built out of legos 
1	phone this phone is one of the best ive ever used 
1	phone it has everything i needed bluetooth infrared support for mmc camera and a good operating system with lots of supporting software 
1	phone i would have given this phone stars if it wasnt for the fact that i would rather use my to do all the most common things you do with a phone 
0	interface its important that people know the following first the interface is slow 
0	interface you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu 
0	lag useable secondly in addition to the lag each time you give a command its just not that easily useable on the go 
0	number buttons fonts interface the number buttons are crammed into a x cm area the fonts are small the interface is too convoluted and frustrating its not that customisable as well 
1	look battery life memory the plusses are the features look good signal and battery life memory size and robustness 
1	camera video the camera and video functionality is decent i cant see myself wasting my time with it but some people will 
1	phone this is a great phone i have this phone since feb and i never have any problem at all 
1	features camera ringtones bluetooth very cool features great camera with zoom cool quality pictures great ringtones bluetooth feature is great 
0	phone this phone is not suitable for fast people maybe only for old people 
0	slow the menu pops up after seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory 
0	time the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy 
0	big at first glance i thought this phone was a little too big for me maybe a little too complicated 
1	phone this thing does everything but washes your dishes 
1	modem i can use it as a modem for my computer connect with clients and friends the possibilities are endless 
1	ringtones screen the ringtones are beautiful the screen is super high quality 
0	carrier i can not find a carrier for this phone i like end up just tossing it in my purse 
1	phone i do not need to repeat whats great about this phone 
0	phone card calling this phone doesnt include phone card calling 
0	phone card calling this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway 
0	feature my old sony ericsson t has this feature 
0	hear in noisy environment its hard to hear from the earpiece 
0	volume speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life 
0	phone unfortunately i sold it exactly a month later 
0	volume a cell phone is to make calls in other words quality of reception and mic speaker are the most important the has a relatively low volume speaker youd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying unless the surroundings were completely quiet 
0	bulky buttons it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use 
0	slow it is slow if you keep the original configuration and progs itll run smoothly but still slower than most other coloured screen nokias 
0	phone my idea was that it was an all in one and that theory once again proves wrong this phone excells at nothing less than average in everything if you seriously need any of the other than phone functionalities youll be disappointed if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine but dont expect to get much done 
0	features basically the is a bundle of over hyped features you dont and wont need none of them work as they should and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average 
0	phone im an advocate of nokia but this phone and the following models are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone 
0	phones im giving it star because as compared to other nokia phones its a compared to other blunders by other companies it might be good but if youre getting a nokia dont get this one 
1	phone i never had a single problem 
1	menu it is nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options 
1	video pictures high quality video and pictures rock 
1	band band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider 
1	phone bottom line great phone for the time being 
1	color tft display camera video i use a nokia it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom which complement a built in video recorder with audio and a realone player for playback and streaming of gpp compatible and realmedia video clips 
1	multimedia functions multimedia functions are enhanced by multi slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone 
1	the nokia is a decent extension of the smartphone line 
1	keypad display rundown time software the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display long rundown time and a good software suite 
0	mmc slot design among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a bit vague design 
1	in short the nokia is an evolution but not a revolution 
1	multimedia im sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email movie times news or any website with this phone 
1	picture you can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call 
1	ringtone give each friend a different ringtone 
1	rings themes get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings 
1	screen a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it 
1	nokia phones nokia makes great phones and this one is the cream of the crop 
1	phone best phone ive ever owned period 
1	phone frankly i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware ive ever used 
1	speed it is slow to initially start up but once its turned on ive never had any complaints about the speed 
1	phone everything so far has worked flawlessly 
1	phone all at the same time and all without a hitch 
1	interface i think the interface is great 
1	i actually purchased two phones recently and this one is far superior 
1	features interface size camera internet connectivity quality i love the features the interface the size the camera the internet connectivity the quality etc 
1	phone if i had to do it over i wouldnt buy anything else 
1	signal upside this one like most nokias receives a consistently strong signal 
1	bluetooth i love the bluetooth easy to use with a wireless jabra headset 
1	photos photos are pretty darned good 
0	speed downside it takes a long time to start up 
0	speed my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use 
0	movies the movies last about seconds 
0	movies i mean theyre short 
0	feature i find this feature on this phone useless but since i dont really need this function anyway i dont really use it 
0	navigatee also when i dial an number like an airline it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu 
0	screen finally after about a weeks use the screen started to freeze on me 
0	calls it would not hang up on calls 
0	screen once it froze so bad i couldnt even use the power button to turn it off and had to open and take out the battery 
1	phone probably a great phone overall and perhaps mine just has bugs 
1	user interfaces bluetooth applications with one of the most intuitive user interfaces around seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on the nokia is all of the above one of the few phones from t mobile that can claim such a distinction 
1	phone ive had this phone for a year now and its the best phone i have owned 
0	camera the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega pixel camera 
1	phone this may be a really cool phone but its not worth it with t mobile 
0	service they have the worst service of any of the major companies 
0	t mobile i really regret signing up with t mobile but im stuck with them for the next months of the contract 
1	phone this phone is fantastic 
1	reception visibility interface great reception visibility and interface 
0	rebate just dont get drawn into t mobiles catchy rebate

1	phone i highly recommend this phone 
1	sony ericsson t i had a sony ericsson t before this and the t is far inferior 
1	battery life im able to keep my phone on for about a week to three days 
1	phone but this by far is the best phone out there right now 
1	screens i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens 
0	os the os is abit confusing at st but within a few days you will pass this learning curve 
1	pics the pics can be touched up in photoshop and be printed at x and they look great 
1	bluetooth i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple powerbook 
1	bluetooth the speed is the same as dail up where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up 
1	phone the phone itself is pretty nice 
1	camera quality camera quality isnt bad for the low resolution 
1	features this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard 
0	motorola t i calls syncing data i was using a motorola t i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data 
1	bluetooth battery life reception screen i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth had decent battery life could check email had good reception nice screen size and was durable 
1	interface the interface is simple to use 
0	menus menu load time i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over exaggerating the menu load time 
1	menu i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds no big deal 
1	menus i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker 
1	camera the camera is adequate and if i want high res photos ill use my digital camera instead 
1	t mobile service on the t mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i and email them to family friends once we reached a t mobile tzone 
1	t mobile service outside of the t mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at t wireless and various other services where the t mobile service was unavailable 
1	reception as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentuckys mountains 
1	battery life connectivity bars features along the way we compared it to my wifes t i and the was superior in terms of battery life connectivity bars and features 
1	isync for those mac osx users out there isync works fairly well 
0	bluetooth on occasion im not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem 
1	bluetooth battery and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would i usually can go days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge 
1	battery with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long 
1	phone the nokia is a great phone good games good camera 
0	video recorders the video recorders a bit odd sometimes i get secs on my recordings sometimes i get 
1	voice recorders the voice recorders good but you cant record songs off the radio for ring tones 
1	games the games are decent but u only get to start off with 
1	games but you can download some really good ones like pac man or mafia wars 
1	phones overall the phones fantastic and i would have given it stars but its not perfect 
1	battery the battery on mine lasts days if i dont play games that much and it only takes mins to charge from flat 
1	battery this phone has the best battery it lasts longer then my old

1	call logs clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people 
1	bluetooth as for bluetooth no problems at all 
1	bluetooth ive connected the phone with two laptops and a ipaq 
1	bluetooth very simple and painless 
1	phone this is the first cell phone ive owned and overall i am quite pleased with it 
1	phone among my requirments for a phone were good screen decent camera bluetooth and gprs support 
1	phone the was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with t mobile 
1	internet one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux where softmodem drivers are hard to find and dont work very well 
1	gprs if you are using linux and you want to use gprs to connect to the net i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter 
1	camera i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone 
1	feature and the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal pop smtp e mail account 
1	e mail i will also say that setting up the e mail account was very simple and straight forward although you do need an external smtp server to use 
1	ringtone the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone 
1	ringtone music which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net 
1	bluetooth you can use the obex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux for sending files to the phone 
1	ringtones the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and or groups is really cool 
0	os i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues 
0	applications sometimes various applications crash 
0	bluetooth especially the bluetooth server meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again 
0	bluetooth this is somewhat annoying but from working with computers 
1	freespeak i really dislike holding a phone to my ear and ive found the freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone 
0	voice dialing system the only main drawback is the fact that the voice dialing system is kinda picky 
0	voice dialing system it takes a while to learn how to use it right and at this point i am able to make about of my calls using it 
0	voice dialing system however it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all dosnt work at all in the car for example 
0	size weight some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone and it has rightfully gotten the nick name the bar of soap which it really is 
1	size weight but if you use all bluetooth accessories as i do its really not an issue 
1	phone all in all this is a great phone 
1	price especially for the price amazon gives it at 
1	phone if you use linux and want grps and or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device and want a decent camera this is the phone for you 
1	phone i really love this phone 
1	t mobile you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour 
1	t mobile have had the nokia for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t mobile 
1	features it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well 
1	signal i almost always get a good strong signal even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest 
1	sound speaker phone the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldnt be easier to use 
1	size shape i like the size and shape 
1	size shape it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket 
0	keys the only problem is the size of the keys 
0	key my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones 
0	kays they really are awfully small 
0	battery life also the battery life isnt great but its sufficient for my needs 
1	calls it also works just fine for international calls 
1	instant messaging its a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable 
1	quality its really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch 
1	t mobile ive had nothing but good luck with t mobile 
1	customer service agents service their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific 
1	calls i never get dropped calls 
1	t mobile i recommend t mobile and the nokia without reservation 
1	os the nokia runs the symbian os which works pretty well for most standard phone fare most of the stuff is not that intuitive but if you actually learn how to use it all theres plenty of neat tie ins 
1	phone use ive had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use 
1	bluetooth i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images calender events contacts and anything else 
1	ringers another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load wav sounds as ringers 
1	ringtones this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones i can get whatever i want 
0	slow the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react meaning when i push the contacts button it takes a while to load this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone 
1	os other than that the simbian series os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if youre willing to hunt for it 
0	rebate these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms 
0	rebate for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check 
0	customer care there is no way you can talk with customer care about this 
0	rebates dont rely on t mobile rebates 
1	features speaker phone web browser camera initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone web browser and ofcourse the built in camera 
1	screen display the good large lcd screen colorful display good resolution 
1	features web browser camera video recorder speaker phone reception nice features like web browser camera video recorder speaker phone clear voice reception 
1	joy stick memory card joy stick for eazy navigation mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff 
0	battery now the bad as usual battery power not sufficient for daily usuage 
1	joy stick memory card joy stick for eazy navigation mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff 
0	battery the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser 
0	slow phone is awfully slow 
0	menu sometimes when you press buttons the menu appears after a second or two 
0	buttons buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging 
0	buttons there will be much erasing of text as one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters 
0	video recorder video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the free picture and video messaging offered by service provider 
1	phone the bottom line is phone is cool one only for the moment as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones 
0	isync compaibility so right out of the box i had issue 
0	sync namely it wouldnt sync 
0	isync compaibility after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem 
0	nokia but i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment

1	phone i am just in love with this phone especially after using a more primitve phone about years 
0	software i have read the installation instructions for both nis and nav prior to installation but still ended up with the same result junk software 
0	norton products but if i installed either one of these norton products neither works after installation 
1	mcafee anti virus it can not be the computer or the owner since i purchased mcafee anti virus and it installs and works fine with no problems 
0	norton i have used norton for the past years and for the last years the software has gotten more and more disgraceful 
0	norton i am glad that i do not work for norton 
0	installation after attempted installs i have finally given up 
0	nis during install nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so 
0	manual shutdown the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the nd bar over and over 
0	norton i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer 
1	nis nis worked like a charm last year 
0	norton being a past norton customer i consider this to be a slap to my face 
0	installed buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non working computer 
0	norton norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products but with this one they have fallen off the cliff 
0	product as a loyal customer of norton symantec products i purchased internet security as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product 
0	program yeah this program protects your computer all right by locking you off the internet 
0	updates other than that it is all the same except the new updates 
1	symantec softwares but that is good for me because symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers 
0	scandisk so far i havent had so much complaints except that i still havent mastered how to scandisk when using internet security 
0	product too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time 
0	suite sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches 
1	speed im not sure why all the bad reviews my computer isnt especially slowed down and i have win 
1	speed sure it slows it down a little but thats expected 
1	semantic perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little but these reviews are highly exagerated i would ask what else these people are running on their computers 
0	nis norton internet security is one of the more buggy implementations 
0	installation this product has virtually all the same installation problems 
0	product for purposes of clarity here is my review from that product edited to be appropriate for this product since for the most part they share many of the same problems 
1	systemworks internet security this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite 
0	internet security this version of internet security is beyond hope 
0	install function they are a royal pain to install and dont function properly once finally installed if you can install them at all 
0	installation the biggest problem is the installation 
0	installed liveupdate system works internet security also if you do manage to get it installed any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and or the process of updating internet security 
0	product ive had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far and ive not to get either product working properly 
0	installation first it serious serious installation problems 
0	install back in may when i first reviewed this it had taken me over hours to install and run 
0	liveupdate almost from the beginning liveupdate would not function 
0	updates first it failed whenever connecting to get updates 
0	liveupdate when i finally got it working it only worked properly for many a month 
0	components the next problem was that it didnt recognize all the installed components so it would not update them most notably and importantly virus definitions 
1	functions once installed however some of the functions do work ok 
1	faster menu these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions and i found the menu to be much more navigable 
0	liveupdate but this doesnt make up for its innumerable other short comings the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate 
0	installs the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this 
0	removal program warning the windows remove program feature does not do a good job of this and neither does nortons own removal program 
0	fragments a lot of fragments were left in the registry and it the norton system folders 
1	remove their website had a download that helped remove those although i had to manually remove a good number of files from the programs directory 
0	install if you have an older version of internet security installed you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install 
0	remove you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry 
0	products as of october these products are not working and im ready to demand a refund from symantec 
0	functionality i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues 
0	reinstall once again it wont reinstall even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians 
0	version the best thing to do with this version is to leave it on the store shelf it doesnt work and will cost you an enormous amount of your time not to mention your hard earned dollars 
0	symantect products personally i may never buy symantect products again 
0	product avoid this product at all costs 
0	edition there are some highs to the edition but mostly lows 
0	program cost the program brings more problems than a virus albeit not as major problems just not what you expect for bucks 
0	support i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs the windows firewall and waited minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a customer priority id number 
0	priority id then when i went to nortons website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given i couldnt find a way to get one 
0	support so i e mailed the online tech support with that simple question and got a reply which was totally unresponsive 
0	norton and when you think about it its insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops anyone who can provide proof of purchase whether on the phone or online should have equal priority 
1	memory usage nortons memory usage on systems with mb is very low 
1	memory usage i just got an older mhz system with pc ram and it also runs fine on that 
1	update both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together 
1	update you wont need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks 
1	visual backtracking the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking 
0	product stay away from this product 
0	i dont know whats happened to norton but is absolute garbage 
0	support the customer support is pathetic 
0	norton internet security i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience 
0	product this product is absolutely not ready for release 
0	slow it is buggy slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user 
0	product i am an it professional and have used norton for years but this product is a complete and utter dud 
0	internet security antivirus its a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus 
0	internet security antivirus software nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software 
0	parental controls even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer 
0	firewall now in october the firewall said i couldnt ok anymore software to use the internet because its full 
0	capacity support im at full capacity i called symantic and they said they dont know why but i should get techs support at hr to help i did call them and was on hold for minutes untill i hung up 
0	product upgrade so dont buy this or upgrade 
0	version if you currently own the version and are looking to upgrade to the version dont 
0	activation process product there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive 
0	product if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product save yourself some money and buy the version 
0	norton program from day one weve had hangups crashes glitches continual reboots long shutdowns due to ccapp exe program running which is a norton program 
0	norton long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot 
0	memory usage we constantly got windows virtual memory low error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and or crashes 
0	support norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer 
0	support norton support is completely pathetic 
0	home version do not buy any home version of norton anything 
1	corporate edition we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only and so far its great 
1	corporate edition ive used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever 
0	norton internet av our norton internet av was terrible right from the get go so id think that if sytemworks is ok now it should remain ok 
1	corporate by the way i use the norton corporate at work with absolutely no trouble 
1	professional version likewise ive heard norton professional version is fine too 
0	home version just the home version of norton internet av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with 
0	work i am an advanced computer user so i cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work 
0	program scan seems the program scan feature did not find the exe file for outlook 
0	support like most of their solutions the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error it was not 
0	symantec it was a symantec error 
0	update after a recent update i can no longer open more then browser window 
0	support ive searched the program and their online tech support and have found no solutions 
0	products this is definitely one of those products especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit 
1	nis ive been using nis for about months and it works well 
1	intrusion norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from 
1	popup blocker anti spam the popup blocker and anti spam are bonuses 
1	nstalling i didnt have any major problems installing this software 
0	components the only problem i had was a few components didnt quite load correctly upon startup but a reboot fixed the problem 
1	working anyhow this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago 
0	installation i give it stars only because the installation process or rather problems that may surface during the installation process can be frustrating to the average computer user 
0	installation if you experience problems with installation you can visit symantecs website click the support tab click the home or home office support and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it 
0	installation cant get easier than that 
0	spam i already knew something was wrong because much of the spam ive seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products 
1	install mine installed no problem 
1	work seems to work great 
0	nis i read many reviews on norton i s from a variety of sources and came to the conclusion that nis was a terrible product and not worth the update 
0	booting booting up my computer took forever 
0	blocking then my ad pop up blocking was completely gone 
0	blocking my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites 
0	tech line again every review written about the tech line is true after waiting close to minutes i finally spoke to a rep 
0	tech after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program 
0	tech they didnt know what the problem could be 
0	support i did it and it was worse the second time around unbelievable 
0	tech basically i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help 
0	unstalling unfortunately it does not give you the option of unstalling them individually 
0	components you can disable some of the individual components but dont be fooled theyre still there and running 
0	norton antispam although i disabled norton antispam it is still there 
1	product this did manage to cut the number of popups during start up from down to 
0	popups but those come up every time 
0	norton charge next the big reason not to buy any norton product if theres a problem with it norton charges to even tell them about it 
0	charge norton sure they say if its their fault you wont get charged but they are the ones who get to decide whether its their fault 
1	nis while it didnt have all the features i would have liked it was better than anything else i could find at the time 
0	installing the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with 
0	install when i purchase software i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry 
1	spam killer also with one click you can help train your spam killer 
1	wizard and the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my lan 
0	download i downloaded this set from norton and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download 
0	help their site offers no live help at all 
0	service support i tried to call norton and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for non tech customer service or they have a tech support number 
0	cost who wants to pay to discuss a defect in a product that just cost 
0	support i finally got a free support number for norton through my isp support staff but waited an hour or more for a voice 
0	refund they said they would refund all the money but a month later they tell me now the back up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping to handle and ship a cd and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails 
0	product support this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support 
0	support after years i now downloaded mccaffees product after calling their support they answered quickly and for free and were very helpful 
0	norton no problems now just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned thier customers 
0	norton i see many other reviews that say the same stay away from norton they dont deserve you or anyone 
1	firewall antivirus antispam parental control its a highly rated kick ass firewall program thats bundled with the venerable norton antivirus plus extras that make this security suite a must have for people who have broadband internet access 
0	version ive alway liked symantec products except for this version 
0	installing if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system 
1	product luckly with rebates this product will cost me nothing it is indeed worth nothing 
0	install uninstall to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted 
0	installation if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system or nortron antivirus the installation will go fine otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly 
0	support what dissapointes me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec if you want support theyll charge you a fee 
1	zone alarm sygate ive tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great 
0	symantec i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version 
1	help the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription 
0	firewall the only way my pc internet works is if i open the firewall program configuration and manually refresh it 
0	symantec symantec should give us all a refund and apology 
0	product i will never buy their product again at this rate and neither should you 
1	product the product has worked perfectly for me on my xp 
1	antivirus no more banner ads pop ups and the reliable antivirus 
1	antivirus i work on word explorer netscape acrobat reader photoshop at same time but still dont see a problem with computer 
1	product this product is way cooler than anything ive used before 
1	product stars all the way 
1	product all in all it hasnt been a bad product 
0	symantec however symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release 
0	boot im currently using a sony vaio s and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system in fact ive taken to just hibernating rather than shutting down completely 
1	performance ive owned many norton products in my time and for the most part ive been pleased with their performance 
1	nis this is also the case with nis 
1	upgrade performance i upgraded from nis and the change in performance has not been noticeable 
1	upgrade on the contrary im quite pleased with my upgrade 
1	performance features it works better and has more useful features than nis 
1	program the program is fully featured with much of what youd want from a security program 
1	installation set up operation interfaces email spam the installation set up and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well 
0	symantec however i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec 
0	performance it feels like im back to the days of k dial up internet service even though im running a dell ghz pentium with mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year 
0	performance i tried disabling the various components provided with this product paring it all the way back to anti virus only service and saw no improvement 
0	symantec norton site there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec norton site 
0	product however i suspect that many people are having a bad experience do not purchase this product 
1	uninstall install piii ghz mb rdram windows xp pro gb hd i was able to uninstall nis and install nis with no trouble 
1	install i installed activated and registered nis without issue 
1	anti spam so far the anti spam feature seems to be very good 
0	program this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online 
0	product buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks 
0	processor i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed and then i couldnt get the damn thing off my computer completely 
0	install it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch 
1	computer associates ez i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ez firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again 
0	norton and i cant warn you enough to stay away from norton 
1	installation i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here 
0	speed it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer 
0	size scanning i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open close scanning that it does with every program 
0	scan is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program 
0	firewall i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory but this firewall just brought it to a halt 
0	slow start up log off log on everything became very slow 
0	home network configuring it for a home network was almost impossible 
0	network multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like youd expect 
0	alerts while i was trying to play half life it started popping up with alerts every twenty seconds warning me my antivirus protection was off 
0	alerts but it wouldnt let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldnt stop with the alerts 
0	uninstall i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago and it wouldnt let me do that either 
0	uninstall i tried it again this morning and it said i didnt have the required permissions and lacked proper administrator status 
0	symantec customer service of course if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay per incident 
0	uninstallation this time it started the uninstallation process then i left for work i think it will work i hope it will work 
0	symantec i simply hate symantec i swear if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare bleeding hands i would have 
1	products their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions 
1	router this router does everything that it is supposed to do so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it 
1	setup installation it was a very quick setup and installation in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up 
1	install by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do 
1	works it works great i am usually at the full mbps although every now and then that drops to around mbps only because i am floors below where the router is 
1	router it really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house 
1	router there are computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router and everybody is happy with it 
1	setup router its the easiest thing to setup i thought and i am only so with all that said buy the router 
0	wizard the wizard is particularly sinister 
0	wizard it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre existing router without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard wired pc or a wireless equipped pc 
0	setup the box proudly displays secureeasysetup wireless made simple one touch setup button easy start easy security easy everyday apparently linksys cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial 
1	router i recently bought the linksys wrt g router and have been very happy with the router itself 
0	configuration however configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than hours and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup 
0	cd too bad they dont mention anything about how the cd cant be used with a mac 
0	user manual i even downloaded the products user manual useless 
0	technical support the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac 
0	instruction i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so 
0	documentation what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems 
0	setup im giving it stars because the setup process was so miserable 
1	product but the product iself is great 
1	router once you set it up its great 
1	well priced and it is extremely well priced for what youre getting 
1	performance another star performance 
1	cd this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time 
1	speed pertaining to the speed issue i got mps while i was in the same room 
1	works this router works at mbps thats megabyte not kilobyte 
1	running i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of plus kilobytes on the download e 
1	broadband broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies 
1	installation installation was as near automatic as can be 
1	equipment all in all this is a star piece of equipment 
0	wep encryption i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa 
1	connectivity even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity 
1	firmware update new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration 
1	configuration all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network 
1	router awesome for the newbie though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself 
1	installation comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router 
1	setting up you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network 
0	costlier linksys is more costlier than others and is a home consumer division of cisco 
0	instructions there were no other obvious setup instructions though there was a softcopy manual it did not give an answer readily on what do to 
0	security the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection 
1	works the router works fine for both wired and wireless 
1	connect i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly 
1	connect overall if you know what basic steps to take it was not difficult to connect and the s w worked well to connect 
0	cd little to no networking experience just in case the automatic cd method has issues 
1	router id give it stars if possible but since stars would be misleading i give it stars 
0	enterprise piece this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment 
1	router i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it 
0	hardware version the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half 
1	wrt g just want a wireless router for home or your very small business you can just get a wrt g from here and configure it 
1	wrt g i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router just get the wrt g 
0	cd i tried the cd setup program without any luck 
1	yes the number probably redirected me to someone in india but the guy was easy to understand and he helped solve the problem 
0	cd essentially the cd included with the package is for the most part worthless 
1	product itll make life a lot easier and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review 
1	router this is my fourth linksys product and aside from the rough start im very satisfied with this router 
1	router this linksys router does it for the right price 
1	range the range is terrific i am using this for my home and i was transferring at mbs from my backyard 
1	wrt g ive since gotten the linksys modem and stacked it with the wrt g router and it works fantastic 
1	set up it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasnt called me yet with any problems 
1	instructions there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging stealing your bandwidth 
1	installation and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lik my aunt to follow 
1	product a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years 
1	security speed i upgraded from an older b router to the linksys wrt g for its improved security and of course speed 
0	router however this product performed well below my expectation 
0	stream copy large files the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music or copy large files over the local network 
0	design after some research on the net i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt g design 
1	security as i mentioned in my first paragraph it supports wpa security which is far superior to wep 
1	setup in addition it is very easy to setup 
1	use security anted to rate the router higher than star due to its security easy of use etc 
1	works so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections 
1	i was fed up and turned to wrt g because of its positive reviews good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs router im happy to say that this router was exactly what i was looking for 
1	setup the setup was very easy 
1	instructions just follow the instructions carefully its all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time 
1	design anteanna the dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick 
1	signals drops and strong signals even from the backyard 
1	security configuration menu the wrt g offers excellent security features and much more configuration menu that i didnt even need a manual to setup correctly 
1	linksys even though you could get a cheap router these days im happy i spent a little extra for the linksys 
1	quality the quality is significant and youll be very happy from saving time and the headache 
1	working i got it working fast enough 
1	router it is a nice router in all ways but one 
0	reliable it is not reliable 
0	access a couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet 
0	access that is you cannot access the internet at all 
0	router very annoying 
1	broadcom hardware i also wanted to switch to broadcom hardware because my wifi minipci card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used of my ghz laptops cpu when using the wireless at full speed 
0	cd the installation software cd crashed repeatedly 
0	connection i then tried to set up the router through linksyss browser interface but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd i had little luck i did manage to connect briefly but the connection kept dropping and with no idea of how to resolve that issue i gave up 
0	wizard i couldnt get the install wizard to work 
1	instructions however setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze 
1	install its easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesnt do a good job of explaining why its important 
0	wizard knocked star off for the install wizard it wasted alot of time running it 
1	linksys while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys 
1	install the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process 
1	support unlike other reviewers i have found the support to be responsive almost no wait time on the phone and relatively knowledgeable 
1	priced overall this router seems like a reasonably priced product th

0	firmware the firmware has bugs too so download and install the latest firmware from linksys

1	cd second the setup cd actually worked perfectly 
1	installation i still need to read up on some of the security settings etc to fully understand all thats up there but bottom line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speedboost router 
0	manual even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with mac settings etc 
1	antenna when i saw a high gain antenna was available to the wrt g router i thought id happily give up some speed in favour of wider coverage 
0	important to note that what i really needed was an access point as my dsl modem already does the router thing and i have a wired m network round the house setup setting up the system was not too complicated 
1	signal having done all this i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal 
1	speed the box is upstairs and in the farthest room i get connected at m speed that is similar to the older m ethernet standard 
1	signal apart from speed the signal is consistent and works without interruptions etc 
1	coverage the wrt g plus the hga t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard walled house as was my case 
0	router we bought this about months ago and its been worthless 
0	connection slow it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow
