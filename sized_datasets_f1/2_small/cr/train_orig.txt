1	stands wire i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base 
1	front channels i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels 
0	stands speakers one thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down

1	price point in addition the price point is spectacular 
1	computer speakers these are the only computer speakers i ve ever bought so i have no comparison to anything else 
0	subwoofer the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers

1	speakers if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for 
0	tonal qualities what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor 
0	speaker crossovers there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers 
0	mid range bass you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels 
1	computer speaker however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb

0	satellites cons i think the satellites look ugly 
0	sub woofer ported sub woofer not appropriate for this set up 
1	speakers this is a preference but since these speakers are more than capable of loud levels i d be willing to sacrifice some efficiency to have an enclosed woofer that is much more accurate and less redolent of a teenager is car system 
0	speaker cable fixed speaker cable why do this 
1	sub woofer sub woofer is large 
1	computer speaker for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary

1	system this is a superb system and highly recommended

1	stereo reproduction the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior 
1	clarity vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well 
1	design sound quality obviously one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage 
1	works sound size price i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower 
0	bass system first of all i disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way 
1	sound they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers 
0	mid range mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers

1	price sound bass bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass 
1	speakers these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park 
1	mount use the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars 
0	bigger it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone 
1	speakers sound i believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your desktop computer or laptop i try this at bestbuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker now when i got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok i have a mac and i wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it is a nightmare to find a fully compatible pci card i found a great plug in for mac i tunes srs iwow after installing the demo i was totally impress by the quality of sound just a great alternative for mac users 
1	loud my brother and i were equally shocked at how loud this thing really is

1	sound the sound became instantly clear again 
1	small upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them 
0	design there are a few things that i do nt like about the design

1	dvd r that is a rare and valuable feature 
1	audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying 
1	forward at double speed it still plays mp s with sound they are pitch corrected and smooth but twice as fast 
0	remote control mp filename weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size

0	remote the remote is okay but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons 
0	button i especially like the more commonly used buttons such as play pause and stop to be larger and conveniently placed 
0	zoom mode i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode

0	color the other thing i do nt like about this is that it makes the color look over saturated

1	media it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player 
1	user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds 
1	player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high end player 
1	look panel and the slim form factor together with the mirror like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey

0	dvd player granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player 
0	menu first the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds

0	player i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died 
1	player i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category 
1	player i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine 
0	noise external display there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance

0	camera i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust 
0	grain the grain was terrible 
0	flash photo noise well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise 
1	photo when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome 
1	camera the camera was a marvel 
1	camera it is versatile and seems to be one of the best 
1	g i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images 
0	lag time flash the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash 
1	depth what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f 
0	flash relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr the internal flash on the g produces harsh flat images with ugly hot spots 
1	external flash hot shoe fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct 
1	flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon 
0	software now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to 
0	software the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera 
1	g what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g hardware 
1	color without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image 
0	software what the g raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical 
1	image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera 
1	raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits 
1	camera i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision 
1	camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well 
1	battery life battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves 
1	manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent downloading pictures is quick and a breeze and the quality is astounding 
1	service the service from the supplier was exceptional 
1	photo having used it for more than a month i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos 
1	photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced 
1	automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes 
0	viewfinder about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder 
1	camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera 
1	canon but canon never fails to amaze 
1	raw format the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing flexibility 
1	battery life battery life is over hours compared to about hours for the g or the hours for most nikons 
1	software the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing 
1	shape the shape of this device is a little squarer without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking 
1	light auto correction the light auto correction is awesome 
1	picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right 
1	white offset perhaps inspired by the canon is factory white correction settings the g has much sharper white offsets 
1	g overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view 
1	camera this is quite simply the best you can ask for 
0	low light focus the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds 
0	picture got way too many blurry pictures 
1	photo use software mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval 
1	camera the powershot g is a great camera 
1	photo because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos 
1	camera megapixels is plenty for all but pros and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera 
1	feature it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features 
0	unresponsiveness the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots 
0	delay it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button 
0	delay canon is g does it consistently 
0	focus shoot it feels slow to focus and unbearably slow to shoot 
0	g unfortunately this digital moment capturing device called the g sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted 
1	camera this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier 
1	picture quality i love the quality of the pictures 
1	picture quality they look fantastic 
1	mp camera the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there 
1	picture with canon you get pictures that appear to be photos not still camcorder shots 
1	control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus 
0	lens cap the included lens cap is very loose on the camera 
0	body the body construction buttons casing etc are too plastic 
0	casing it had a heavier and more sturdy casing

1	camera this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it 
1	battery life another point of note the battery life is incredible

1	menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera 
1	battery the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging 
1	optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom 
0	viewfinder one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder but does not detract from the image at all 
1	camera the best megapixel x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use 
1	camera because this camera is beautiful 
1	look the g looks like a work of art 
1	finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen 
1	camera i am very pleased with it so far 
0	viewfinder you can see the lens barrel in the view finder 
0	tiff format there is no tiff format 
0	lag it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter 
1	import it is very simple to import via iphoto and then move them to photoshop 
1	camera i am quite happy with the camera 
1	manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep 
1	camera yes i recommend it over the competition 
1	camera best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything 
1	stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website 
1	picture first and foremost it will take better pic is than most film camera is 
1	camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time 
1	camera however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice 
1	design feature use battery it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing 
1	display also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage 
0	compactflash one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough 
1	noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen 
1	camera i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything 
1	camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera 
1	use design in general it is easy to use and well laid out 
1	use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly 
1	feature the g has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi pro pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography 
1	auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode 
0	memory card the included memory card is too small 
0	made it is made of plastic 
0	lens the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot 
0	size while light it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets 
0	lever the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile 
0	flash flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost 
0	strap the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to 
1	camera the functionality on this camera is mind blowing 
1	option canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out 
1	learning learning how to use it will not take very long 
1	image quality the image quality is excellent 
1	function range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography 
1	camera this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used 
1	macro auto mode the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot 
1	camera this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel 
1	mp resolution i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology 
0	distortion yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture 
1	shot in terms of the shots taken this camera is insanely great 
1	picture learning curve the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to 
1	picture quality i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow car boat and wind 
1	camera the camera is a work of art science that is understood 
1	picture feel it takes great pictures operates quickly and feels solid 
0	viewfinder to address two previous somewhat negative reviews yes the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder however the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder 
0	design this camera has a major design flaw 
0	viewfinder when you look through the viewfinder the bottom left corner of the picture is blocked by the lens 
1	camera everything else about the camera is great 
1	camera if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder i highly recommend the camera 
1	camera and so far i ve been very pleased 
1	lens optical zoom the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer 
1	lcd the moveable lcd screen is great 
1	remote the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures 
1	hot shoe flash the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit 
1	battery i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse 
1	battery charging system the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery 
1	manual i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear 
0	highlight i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better 
0	no off button the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera 
0	body and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s 
1	download i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files 
1	camera i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it 
1	camera use photo very comfortable camera easy to use and the best digital photos you re going to get at this price 
1	g i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised 
1	camera all in all i believe this is arguably the best non slr digital camera on the market 
1	optic canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better 
1	digital camera simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point 
1	battery life the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon and is better than anything else i ve seen 
0	look the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots 
1	camera even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under 
1	camera definetely a great camera 
1	quality lens proven canon built quality and lens 
1	feel feels solid in hand 
1	sd we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd 
1	design it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point and shoot weve ever tested 
1	image processing system a digic ii powered image processing system enables the sd to snap a limitless stream of megapixel photos at a respectable clip its start up time is tops in its class and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition 
1	image the sd rivals the canon g in image quality 
0	pricey i thought given all the reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey 
0	lcd i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen 
0	lcd when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen cracked and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen black and blue and purple blotches and streaks useless 
1	camera this camera is truely superb 
1	pictures the startup time quality of pictures and videos is outstanding 
0	manual control some more manual control would have been nice 
1	pictures they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact 
1	canon i went out and got the canon today 
1	picture ive taken about hundred shot with the canon in varying lighting situations all in auto mode and not one blurry picture 
1	canon i did not conduct a rigorous test but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras and the canon won hands down 
1	pictures sharper pictures 
1	size the canon is very small definitely pocket size but still easy to hold firmly 
1	powers up it powers up quickly so you wont miss that quick shot 
0	flash the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered 
1	image good image quality 
1	pics user interface battery charger all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd are both rich and color and high in detail the user interface is awesome the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time 
0	lcd after reading reviews of lcd problems cracked black blobs etc i figured that it was probably a very limited problem 
0	lcd after pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings 
1	weight camera is a paper weight 
1	sd i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot images so far with it 
1	pictures the pictures are tack sharp colors are vivid and at mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire 
1	powerup powerup is quick and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on 
1	x mode quality i have especially enjoyed the x mode while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe 
0	camera shake you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with 
1	audio audio is mono and fairly acceptable quiet also with little distortions 
1	battery the battery life is not that of the casios but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got 
0	autofocus the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can 
0	compact i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature 
0	manual controls also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls 
1	image glad to see the ed revised the previous statements regarding image quality 
1	focuses my sd focuses flawlessly does not whine during video and my pictures are razor sharp 
1	camera this camera is bulletproof 
1	start up start up is so quick 
1	pictures you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on literally 
1	lcd big lcd screen at least for me is enough 
1	picture great picture quality in automatic mode quality is great 
1	quality when you learn how to change some settings you can make the quality even better 
1	zoom digital zoom is clear too say you used all x optical zoom try to do digital zoom then just try not to shake the camera at all and youll still get a clear good quality picture 
1	zoom great video clip quality for a digital camera so much better than my old one the megapixel one 
1	clips i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips i give it stars oh and btw while you take video clips you can zoom it too but still 
1	merge pictures photo stitch 
1	camera turn the camera on while pressing the button and itl show you the time and date 
0	battery battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times the camera battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but its normal 
0	sound the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera 
1	camera pictures i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures 
1	features if youll only read the whole manual youll find out even more cool features and youll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading 
1	camera its such a great camera i think it really was worth the investment 
1	designed if you havent noticed they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self timer 
1	made they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you dont like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self timer 
1	camera i bought this camera two days ago and im very pleased to say that it has been worth the money 
0	low light conditions only downside is when taking pictures in low light conditions without the flash 
1	automatic settings if you on the other hand always use automatic settings you should be just fine as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen 
1	camera all in all this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price 
1	digic ii chip having the digic ii chip helps a lot 
1	pictures size this camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat 
1	starts up i still cant believe how fast it starts up 
1	camera i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice 
1	sd i still have my s because i like the wider lens sometimes but in general if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package the sd is the only one you should buy 
1	edges i love the rounded edges now fits so much better in a pocket jeans or suit 
0	lcd the sd has only been in my possession for a little over months and the lcd has been broken twice 
0	lcd i took it out one day and the lcd was not working 
0	lcd although the sd takes great quality photos the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall 
1	camera i tell you now after lot of shooting in many different situations this camera is amazing 
1	size the size of the camera is perfect 
1	fits fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket 
1	camera there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things 
1	pictures i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher isos but i dont really care that much i think it gives the pictures a certain real life quality 
1	flash the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent 
1	camera id be happy to talk to anyone about this camera 
1	camera movie mode this camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot

1	camera ive only had this camera for a few days but its been great 
1	photo the photo quality is amazing 
1	feels looks its fast feels great in your hand and looks great too 
1	prints ive printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views 
1	image as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen 
1	colors video another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty price tag and get a quality camera 
1	camera moreover apart from the plastic cable cover the camera has a nice solid feel about it and its so tiny i take it with me wherever i go 
1	camera as it turns out this is an awesome camera 
1	preset user definable however this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes 
0	advanced controls i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd are not as robust but overall picture quality goes head to head with the digital rebel 
1	software documentatio the sd software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed 
1	camera bottom line this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck

1	camera this is overall the best point and shoot camera ive used

0	power button the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print share button dont have a nice click 
0	buttons the buttons are rather stiff 
1	switch i also tend to like the sliding cover on switch found on many compact ps cameras since its much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot 
1	build macros results video quality flash white balance overall build quality good macros results impressive video quality good pictures with flash excellent auto white balance 
1	camera could be better to be a perfect camera purple fringing details in high light area noise over iso red eyes processing artefacts loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light automatic autofocus whizing while video playback better video comression more manual controls longer lasting battery indicator for battery better protection of the lcd less weight 
1	camera image when the overall image quality is the most important thing then this camera ist top notch and very impressive 
1	flash in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p 
0	settings some adjustments in the settings could help make it better

0	controls the controls are hard to manipulate especially in the dark 
0	lcd the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones 
1	small i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason 
1	camera size im in high school and this camera is perfect for what i use it for carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to of my friends and of funny things that happen 
0	memory the only thing i dont like is the small size memory card that comes with it 
0	room i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next and i dont have enough money to buy the meg card that ive had my eye on for a while 
0	memory battery a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy 
0	pictures other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as id like them 
1	camera id say that this camera is perfect 
1	compact ok not quite everything but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it 
1	size i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it or have already bought it its size 
1	small it is amazingly small its hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera 
1	small durable it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket and i dont have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable 
1	covering there is also a small covering for the lens so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched 
1	picture small the picture quality surprised me when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good but i was wrong 
1	picture the picture quality of this camera is outstanding 
0	battery first off the battery 
0	battery this camera uses a lithium battery i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient because what if you are on vacation where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there 
0	battery not only is it inconvenient but also the battery life span is short 
0	batteries this isnt uncommon in cameras though just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries you should be fine 
0	zoom another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function 
0	zooms such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in wrong 
0	zoom the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet 
0	start up even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little resulting in a noisy start up 
0	flash the flash is very weak 
0	macro the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function 
0	auto focus the auto focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject 
0	work to make matters work there is no manual override to overcome this problem 
1	focus the focus is great though if you are not taking a macro shot 
0	cameras its not my first choice in cameras 
1	size i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size 
1	camera if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times then this is a great camera choice 
1	s after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace i decided on the s 
1	camera it has given me zero problems and the more i use it the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths 
0	small it is perhaps too small 
0	buttons read i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on 
0	size its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge 
0	delay shots the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots 
0	autofocus this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system 
0	resolution setting the lack of an intermediate resolution setting as other reviewers have suggested is a problem but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card 
0	hot the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away 
0	hot it is hot enough to be annoying 
1	small pictures this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo quality printer

1	camera i love this camera 
1	camera i dont believe this camera is still available but if you can find one you might like to get it

1	purchase i am very pleased with my purchase 
1	camera ive been incredibly happy with this camera 
1	camera this camera is great if youre used to a high end slr 
1	snapshots its overkill for simple snapshots unless youve got way too much money to blow 
1	exposure exposure compensation in stop increments 
1	flash mode slow syncro flash macro infinity mode etc 
1	body the ss body is wonderful feels high quality 
1	body its the same body as the popular elp aps camera 
0	lcd i left the camera in my car in maine and the lcd screen cracked 
0	design i then realized a major design flaw 
0	functionality all the cameras functionality is only available when the screen is functional 
0	screen when the screen stops working youre out of luck 
1	manual mode i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure white balance flash 
0	viewfinder the viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken 
0	zoom the digital zoom is crap 
1	fits it fits in your pocket 
1	panorama setting the panorama setting is unbelieveable

0	price the price is more 
0	software i originally gave this camera stars when i had windows it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is sooo not compatible with xp 
0	drivers the new drivers on cannons site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software 
0	software the adobe software also was wonderful in but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application 
1	pictures but it takes gorgeous pictures for a mp camera 
1	camera i love this camera 
0	memory the only thing i dont like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card first thing 
1	price i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon 
1	camera i would recommend this camera unequivocally 
1	camera i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon 
1	camera i would recommend this camera unequivocally 
1	battery but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing great battery saver 
1	camera a great camera but here are some points which i dont notice in most of the reviews here which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer 
1	elph s i purchased the elph s mainly because i thought it was cool 
1	exposure prints the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great 
1	smaller resolution but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution i had to have the s 
1	s this is my second digital camera but im much more impressed with the canon s digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc 
1	light tiny this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me which is great considering im an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting 
1	software the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive 
1	software the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any degree panorama shots 
0	on camera controls my only complaint and the reason i gave it stars instead of is that the on camera controls arent as intuitive as they should be 
0	work ive often struggled to get something to work the way i want it and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time 
1	camera other than that i love this camera 
1	pictures color rendering the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect 
1	size metal case use picture quality software the good small size durable seeming metal case easy to use visually distinctive good picture quality fast usb connection mostly intuitive operation really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas 
1	size s if compact size is your highest priority in a megapixel camera the canon powershot s digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design 
1	image quality weighs the s s image quality rates in the middle of its class but it can still be a reasonable choice for students families or small businesses looking for an ultra portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack 
1	camera i purchased this camera before it went on sale and while i wouldnt have minded keeping the extra it was definitely worth it 
1	product i have been absolutely completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities 
1	product this is a great product and canon has done an excellent job 
1	jewel i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say iabsolutely love it 
1	usability performance expandability looks i give this product five stars for its usability performance expandability and definitely looks 
0	price i bought it new when it was cutting edge and very expensive 
1	camera software first i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software 
1	software the software has been installed on windows and xp and i havent had any problems with it 
1	camera performs picture battery the camera is solid performs well takes good pictures and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder 
0	pictures all that said i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera 
1	sharp color balance focus they are razor sharp the color balance is perfect and the focus is great 
0	pictures of people when taking pictures of people however it shows every flaw in the subjects skin 
0	pics other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better 
0	processing i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture 
1	camera i must say i think this is the coolest camera ive ever owned 
1	size first it really is tiny the size of a pack of cigarettes maybe a scooch deeper 
1	use second it is incredibly easy to use 
1	photos i just went on a quick photo shoot in nycs central park today and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took if i do say so myself 
1	use the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot and with instant review on the lcd screen you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot 
1	optical zoom cap the two times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly and lo and behold a two piece shutter like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off 
1	software i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc 
1	s at any rate if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back consider the canon s digital elph 
1	camera it really is the perfect travel camera plus it offers the convenience of digital photography 
0	why did i wait so long detail color rendition if youre looking for a digital camera to replace your big nikon or canon slr forget it film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical 
1	use images fits really like it easy to use great images very intuitive fits in my jacket pocket 
1	compact rugged use i was looking for a compact rugged camera which is easy to use 
1	memory expansion macro mode housing i wanted standard memory expansion macro mode and if possible a waterproof housing 
1	small even with the waterproof housing it is small 
1	lens the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you dont need to fuss with a lens cap 
1	housing the metal housing seems very rugged 
0	automatic modes id give it stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes 
0	auto mode for example in auto mode you cant use the flash redeye reduction you must be in manual mode for that 
0	auto color balance the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds 
0	dynamic range the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc 
1	macro mode the macro mode works well although it takes some practice since the camera doesnt clearly indicate when it cant focus 
1	lcd the white led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp even in sunlight and relatively easy on the battery 
1	panorama modes the panorama modes are wonderful 
1	small light its so small and light even with a spare battery you really can take it anywhere 
1	auto mode in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera

0	buttons buttons are little but if you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch you can deal with almost anything 
0	buttons buttons size is ok for me my wife but not my grany 
1	ease of use picture detail i was looking for something that wasnt too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detial 
1	size casing this camera is great wonderfully small and has attactive hi tech casing 
1	ease of use very easy to use for someone like me whos just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon 
1	controls ease of use the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use 
1	zoom the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective x zoom 
1	capacity this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory for example 
1	size so why the small digital elph rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality size because unless its small i wont cary it around 
1	size pictures after getting one for christmas from amazon im now a believer the digital elph is truly the worlds smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures 
1	pictures ive had this camera just over years and it takes pretty good pictures

1	size you willdefinitly appreciate the small size 
1	affordability while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability 
1	bang for the buck it is the most bang for the buck out there 
1	size weight navigational system sound like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound 
1	screen the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger now blue backlit screen which is infinitely better 
1	deal i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money 
1	wma file another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it 
1	software the software is great 
1	software transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy 
1	battery life even the battery life is great it advertises hours it is actually a little less but still good 
0	accessory only problem no accessories yet

1	sound the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s 
0	navigation navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well 
1	weight at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod 
1	battery leather case the battery is replaceable and there is a leather case 
1	software so far the software for the pc works easily 
1	looking by the way it looks nice also 
1	player it is worth it 
1	battery life price my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both 
1	control the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing 
1	scroll wheel the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad 
0	size it could be a little bit bigger but it is easy to get used to 
0	screen the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue 
0	firewire it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves 
1	leather pouch the included leather pouch is a big plus it actually protects the unit well something a lot of carrying cases fail to do with other audio devices 
1	battery construction size weight other plusses changable battery loads of presets for environments decent construction still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod 
1	size sound price overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod 
1	battery 
1	player price the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player 
1	player i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever 
1	menu the music is easy to get to and if you know how to search for an artist by name online then you can do the same with the zen 
1	screen the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long 
1	player use software sound all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound 
1	program it is a very intuitive program 
1	installation i had no problems following their installation instructions 
1	menu the menus are very easy to navigate 
0	scroll wheel the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks 
1	control the other controls are all very easy to use 
1	play option it has several play options one of the best is an option to shuffle based on all or a certain playlist 
0	playlist the only downside i see is that it does nt look like you can manage playlists from the nomad it has to be done from the computer 
1	price it also costs a lot less than the ipod 
1	earbud the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad 
1	earbud they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality 
1	deal this is a good deal for music and data storage 
0	software the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software 
0	software the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use 
0	player the player itself has all sorts of problems 
0	face plate the face plate which pops out for the battery pops open by itself every minutes or so 
0	file transfer the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset 
0	scroll the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others 
0	scroll depressing the scroll button is not always responsive 
0	scroll the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating 
1	sound on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured 
1	audio i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs 
0	player overall a very disappointing product 
0	setup interface the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par 
0	player the player is mechanics are also flawed 
0	player although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product 
1	price when it came down to it the price on this player is hard to beat 
0	scroll one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like 
1	this thing other than that this thing is great 
1	battery zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod 
1	battery the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance 
0	earphone software deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software 
1	nomad i love my new nomad its great 
1	price for some this might be a problem but for the price of a gig ipod you can get a gb nomad the ipod simply pales in comparison 
1	software the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds 
1	case the free carrying case is really protective and to me its the only accessory you need 
1	deal mp player but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad 
1	player best electronic i ve bought since i was born 
1	set up so easy to set up had some problems with my archos 
1	nomad explorer just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking by artist song title genre etc 
1	player look not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy 
1	design very sleek stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has 
1	leather case the leather case it comes with is pretty nice similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly 
1	button all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand 
1	sound quality the sound quality is also nice after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with 
1	sound option lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options 
1	navigation navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch 
1	navigation also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player 
1	screen saver oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet 
1	file limit another plus in my book no file limits 
1	playlist i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up 
1	storage i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder 
1	player i really have no complaints over this unit 
1	player i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player

0	manual also the instruction manual is very bad 
1	player i have no complaints with this mp player 
1	file transfer getting files onto it is quick and painless 
1	sorting then sorting the files is easy as pie 
1	storage and it holds sooooo much music and audio files 
1	player my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems 
1	battery the battery is nice 
1	screen the lcd screen was very large and readable 
1	player compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck 
1	zen i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class 
0	transfer transfering i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb or 
0	transfer it would only transfer or so songs and then come up with an error 
0	scroll wheel scroll button the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling 
0	size size bigger than the ipod 
0	software software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut 
1	sound quality sound quality was the same between the two but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features 
1	player i love this player 
0	player all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once but it has nt done it since 
1	player i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again 
1	software the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account 
1	player anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it 
0	size weight look folder structure first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture 
1	price way less expensive than the ipod 
1	interface i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx 
0	folder structure the cons are nt really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it is based on the title of the songs many of my songs where seperated into folders and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did nt have any that might be the same as another 
0	chinese name and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title 
1	transfer not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless 
1	xtra bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent 
1	storage i still have over gb left and already have over cd is on it 
1	interface software both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice 
1	transfer ripping transferring tunes is basic and pretty fast 
1	case people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection 
1	case it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to 
1	sound quality look screen battery the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod 
1	option you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well 
0	button the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing 
0	button my fast forward button works but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go 
1	button all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well 
1	support but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary 
0	size sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much 
1	size weight it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy 
1	product price bottom line great product unbeatable price 
0	id tag unlike my other mp players this thing will only work properly if you have id tags on all of your tracks 
0	id tag if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders 
1	player i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it 
1	setup transfer the setup and transfer process was cake for me 
0	transfer i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was nt a big problem 
0	explorer the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again 
0	player the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well 
1	player now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems 
1	screen the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it 
1	eax mode the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides 
0	jog dial the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do nt figure out a way to break it 
1	mp player all in all though i m very happy with my new mp player 
1	nomad i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic 
0	installation i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver 
1	software i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy 
1	playlist ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier 
1	mediasource i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer 
1	playback quality being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable 
1	sound when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra it is that good 
1	sound quality the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior 
1	nomad actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated 
1	finding finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy 
1	screen the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight 
1	use playback quality price i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use playback quality and value for the price 
1	player just bought one i ve enjoyed it to date 
1	size nice palm sized unit somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you re not going to try jog with it or something 
1	sound quality all reviews i ve seen seem to indicate that the creative mp jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these nd generation jukeboxed 
1	eax the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative 
0	player i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment 
0	control the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones 
0	fly wheel the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use 
0	button the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical 
0	software included creative software is pretty poor 
1	price great value gb vs gb ipod for the price 
1	sound best in class sound 
1	screen large easy readable screen 
0	play i tried to play the song three times with no success 
0	play it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk 
0	software had there been strange noises or obvious defects i would have accepted a replacement but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches 
1	player working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks 
1	player i love it 
0	player this product is too fragile for normal use 
1	software i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred 
0	software however the creative software is not real intuitive 
0	software the software is somewhat nice to look at using it is not the easiest 
0	rename if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly 
1	transfer transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 
1	sound it is great sounding even with the supplied earbuds 
1	earbud i must have differing preferences than others here as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony is that i thought sounded good on other players 
1	storage i love the storage in this thing 
0	warranty this is ridiculous 
0	scroll wheel the scroll wheel to be blunt sucks 
0	scroll wheel seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection 
0	interface the interface used could be better designed 
0	interface it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want 
0	case and the case how did this ever make it out of quality control 
0	case it is some protection for the unit but for useability forget it 
0	control the cut outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls especially the scroll wheel 
1	player despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc 
0	lock up however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times 
0	firmware quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time 
0	warranty i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous 
1	player this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product 
0	size weight the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more 
0	scroll the scroll button is nt the best as it sometimes can be hard to select 
1	sound quality first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod 
1	software the player is software is very easy to use and very good 
1	software compared to musicmatch the software has a better filing system and easier to use 
1	player to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod 
1	player this thing seriously is a good player though 
1	unit overall i like the unit 
0	player i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance 
1	price price gb of storage 
1	storage storage capacity 
1	battery user replaceable battery 
0	construction fragile 
0	scroll scroll button switch 
0	case the case hides the display you have to open it to see what you are doing 
1	player overall i like it 
1	storage the storage capacity is great 
1	price the price compared to the ipod is great 
1	price battery price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad 
0	itunes but for now it appears that this player does nt play well with itunes 
0	scroll the scroll bar is a bit of a pain 
1	software i ve had no problems with the software 
1	software i found it intuitive to use 
1	software this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem 
1	software the software comes with plenty of defaults genres 
1	sound the sound from the player is ok 
0	sound i was a little disappointed in the low end 
0	sound the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected 
1	this thing this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records 
1	storage one good thing it is gb of disk space 
1	price feature for the price and features it is really good 
0	navigation in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders 
0	navigation you even can not navigate by genre artist album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre no other division 
0	software the software which comes with player is not good at all 
0	nomad explorer i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work 
0	software so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly 
1	zen the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car 
1	battery life online music service pc compatibility longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities 
1	player i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it 
1	sound battery life price the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent 
1	style size control the nomad is not ugly it is not that big it comfortably fits in my pocket or heavy and the controls are not hard to get used to 
1	player so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing 
0	player this thing is trash 
0	construction a feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop 
0	screen b the screen is hard to read the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display 
0	scroll c the scroll bar is a travesty enough said 
0	software d software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up doesnt work with mp s the list goes on and on 
0	case e the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage 
0	look f it doesnt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course 
0	software the software failed repeatedly 
0	customer support website creative labs customer support website is useless 
0	software software downloads on the site crashed my pc 
1	player i just bought this player today and i already love it 
0	play it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd 
0	scroll another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on 
1	player otherwise this player is awesome 
1	screen it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily 
1	volume range the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want 
1	player overall this player is awesome and i definately recommend it 
1	this item i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards 
1	price naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable 
1	value compared to other leading hdd mp players the value per gb is the tops 
1	sound quality sound quality excellent everything you would expect from this company 
1	use the unit is easy to use and intuitive 
1	uploading uploading music is quick and easy 
1	software although the supplied software can be annoying at times on whole it is excellent 
1	player button the unit itself its well structured with just the buttons you need and none you do nt 
1	scroll as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible 
1	screen the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool 
1	feature there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization 
1	battery the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily 
1	battery life also the nomad is hours of battery life versus is handy 
1	equipment equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for 
0	case the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window 
1	headphone the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead 
1	player this player is an ideal purchase 
1	player i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player 
0	software on my main computer the software did not work right 
0	customer support i had to sit on the phone with customer support for hours and they did not help at all 
1	player i have the software working fine now and the mp player is fantastic 
1	player so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp player is worth the money it cost 
1	zx i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review 
1	size it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx 
1	sound quality the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod however it compromises a bit of the unit is size in doing so 
1	lcd the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did 
1	scroll wheel the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate 
1	sound the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product 
1	eax the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle 
0	enviromental audio the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it 
1	signal to noise ratio the signal to noise ratio is nice and high at decibles and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods 
1	software the software has nt been a hassle for me at all 
1	price lastly the price is fantastic 
1	software i uploaded the drivers and new software in minutes no crashes or problems 
1	usb usb very fast 
0	earbud yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap replace them 
1	sound but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers 
1	recharger and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world 
1	look size weight it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light 
1	scroll the scroll button seems ok i have no problems with it 
1	player i am very pleased so far 
1	use very simple to use 
0	battery a spare battery would have been great 
0	game no games it has a cool screen why not use it 
0	work it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer like some players 
1	use all in all suprisingly easy to use 
1	sound quality size price lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy 
1	sound excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox 
1	transfer transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad 
1	transfer i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer 
1	storage huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing 
1	transfer having usb makes for very fast transfers 
0	navigation navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs 
0	fm receiver fm receiver it has none 
0	construction cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners 
0	feel the player feels very delicate as if i m holding an actual hard drive 
0	feel as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable 
0	play the songs do nt play one after another like on a cd 
0	software software the software is crap 
1	rip cd i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of 
0	software otherwise it is difficult to figure out and awkward 
0	instruction even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out 
0	line out jack no line out jack as i said there is none 
0	line out jack it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack 
0	control controls are a bit awkward 
0	control it was nt as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman 
0	headphone crappy headphones 
0	earbud the included earbuds were uncomfortable 
0	navigation difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate 
0	navigation it is a bit cumbersome and i can t get to the songs i want as quickly 
0	navigation i think this is it is biggest flaw 
0	control up down left and right would have given me better control 
0	scroll wheel if you hold down the scroll wheel too long it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo nt stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it 
0	case it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack 
0	case as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand 
1	player overall i feel that it is a decent buy and am happy that i own it 
1	price for the price and size and features you can t beat the price 
1	button interface the buttons and interface are very easy to use 
1	click buttons display simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use 
0	software but the major problem i had was with the software 
0	instruction the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple 
0	sync the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful 
0	transfer i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused 
1	mp player with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod 
1	interface i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer 
1	product i have had no problem what so ever with this product 
1	software the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows k machine 
0	headphone the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity 
1	battery life the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs 
1	navigation took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo 
1	player i have nt messed with the firmware at all the player worked perfect for me right out of the box 
1	product all in all this is another excellent creative product 
1	size weight look display it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well 
1	product i would recommend this product to anyone 
1	player before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there 
1	software many people have written about the software being its one downfall personally i have nt had a single problem with the software i m running windows me 
1	cd rip the cd ripping to mp is so easy and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp player so it wo nt take up space on your pc hard drive 
1	software the software runs smooth it is nice to look at it is very organized easy to follow and makes things very simple 
1	control the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual 
1	player sound the player is fast and sounds great it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music or making it sound like you re hearing the music in a huge auditorium 
1	battery the battery lasts very long when playing music but writing files to the player drains the battery fast so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files 
1	playlist playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists 
1	software player the software could nt be better and the mp player works like a dream i could nt give this anything but a i wish there was a 
1	player it is an extremely cool gizmo 
0	playlist creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked 
0	sound quality my only significant complaint is sound quality 
0	eax the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq 
0	sound quality i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with bass boost 
1	product well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket 
1	product well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp player 
0	program well just one con its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it it will be a breeze 
1	price player not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have 
1	battery life it hasnt gone below the second notch so the battery life seems fine 
0	id tag my only complaint would be that you need id tags that takes a while to do if your mp files do nt have them 
1	transfer oh and file transfers are fast easy 
0	weight a little weighty but otherwise fine 
1	scroll wheel it is easy 
1	button the buttons are easy to use and its easy to navigate 
1	backlight the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see 
1	eax my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature 
1	eax its really cool 
1	sound quality sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse but its really good 
1	song speed you can also slow a song down speed it up which is cool too 
0	earbud but the earbuds suck 
0	case i forgot the case does nt fit 
0	case my case doesnt close maybe mine was just faulty but the case isnt that great 
1	storage also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy 
1	player hardware first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good 
0	software what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software 
0	bookmark bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player 
0	bookmakr rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made 
0	bookmark this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks 
0	playlist the dynamic playlists feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate 
1	price while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player 
1	nomad i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it 
1	storage capacity the storage capacity is great for me 
0	control the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price 
0	load loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well 
0	tag software my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software 
0	tag other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system 
0	software also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order 
0	playlist finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order 
1	product the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product 
1	software a lot of people complain about the creative software but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes 
1	sync first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer 
1	shuttle the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources you can t do this on the ipod 
1	sync second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer 
1	player the zen serves as a back up device as well as a player 
1	software third creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer 
0	cd burner only thing missing from creative is a cd burner 
1	creative for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages 
1	scroll zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player 
1	remove it also lets you remove songs from the play order 
1	delete if you bring up an album but absolutely hate some of the tracks the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order 
1	zen its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus 
1	this thing i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since 
0	control look the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are nt as easy as the ipod is or as sexy looking 
1	software the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered 
0	headphone as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away 
1	the unit the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road 
1	unit overall it is a great unit hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it 
1	size this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size 
1	case it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly 
0	cover the front cover feels flimsy but when snapped on the device still feels pretty solid 
1	software extremely convenient 
1	price great price 
1	software i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all 
0	scroll the scroll button is sort of annoying to push a nice button would be nicer but eh not a big deal 
0	size it is slightly larger than an ipod no doubt about it 
1	player i m really happy with this purchase 
0	size i would have liked to have given it stars docking that star only for the size 
1	screen equilizer now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and ive heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here 
1	case but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything 
1	price sound ive seen em all the archos dell ipods everything good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion 
0	weight size its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket 
0	playlist its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod 
0	battery life it also has unproven battery life 
0	software finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best 
1	price capacity price and capacity 
1	design interface slick looking design and improved interface 
1	battery removable battery 
0	case protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window 
0	scroll scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models 
0	eax eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp files 
0	volume does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers 
0	software software is absolutely terrible 
0	transfer will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles 
0	recognition does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library 
0	change too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks 
0	software you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best 
1	size despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box 
1	cd rip i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me 
1	transfter file transfers are fast nearly a song per second via usb 
0	software my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field 
1	sound to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player 
1	eax the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train 
0	navigation navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it 
1	player at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria 
1	this i got this for christmas and it is a great gift 
1	use i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful 
1	memory the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs my entire collection of cd is will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun 
1	battery sound plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad 
0	software case the only two things that stop me from giving it stars are the ho hum software that comes with the system and the traveling case it comes with 
1	rip quality ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good 
1	player considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player 
1	sound quality it is really a shame because otherwise creative mp players are very good and have the best sound quality of any players on the market 
1	zen xtra after some consideration i chose the gb nomad zen xtra from creative and i have not been disappointed 
1	battery first the battery is replacable by the user because creative intended it to be unlike apple with the ipod 
1	battery it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted 
1	software the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could nt be easier to use 
1	playlist cd rip you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player 
1	transfer and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy 
1	sound volume the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise 
1	earbud i thought i d have to buy a set of headphones to use with it but the included earbuds work quite well 
1	earbud they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department 
1	equalizer i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too 
0	clip however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off 
0	case also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display 
0	player software this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues 
1	storage i achieved my basic objective my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more 
1	stoppage the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation a slightly audible click if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do nt even notice the click 
0	software creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what 
0	mediasource mediasource did not recognize my tags 
0	eax despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax 
0	eax creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static 
0	mediasource mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws 
0	folder structure the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk 
0	storage in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection 
0	stop button the zen does not have a stop button 
0	manual but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version 
0	usb recharge the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge it does not charge by usb cable this is not tragic but usb recharging would be a convenient choice 
0	mediasource mediasource did not install on my personal notebook 
1	notmad m u files are used by most mp players like musicmatch and winamp but not creative without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists it does nt care what software you use to rip or catalog your music creative or any other company all my gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags hooray 
1	software given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software 
1	player now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it 
1	memory i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory 
1	sound quality the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes 
1	navigation it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device 
1	operate i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive 
0	software the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated 
1	napster one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software 
0	name they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name 
0	player i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason 
1	storage the memory is staggering 
1	musicmatch software i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit 
1	screen screen was good easy to read 
1	sound quality sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great 
0	software the software that came with it was tough to load 
0	battery top the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch 
0	top the top did not fit well into the unit 
0	cover the cover that came with it did nt fit very well

0	creative product i will never buy a creative product again 
0	thing i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing

1	wake up wake up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time 
1	play mode multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter

1	storage big storage my entire cd collection in one small device 
0	plug and play player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it

0	folder folders cannot be created for the audio files 
0	fm voice recording no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras 
0	accessory lack of good accessories this is more of an oversight of creative is marketing

0	software software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad 
0	player i am annoyed that the player is not automatically recognized as a hard drive 
0	player i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work 
1	product sound use i loved this product when i first got it great sound easy to use and held enough songs to suit any mood 
0	durability i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero 
0	hard drive always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped 
0	player i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler 
1	player the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market

0	id tag having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown 
0	nomad explorer with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software 
0	nomad explorer in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 
1	player my first impression was positive 
0	eax first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes 
0	menue control second the menu system and controls are poorly designed 
0	scroll the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well 
0	button the general button placement is not very user friendly 
0	case third the poor design continues with the case 
1	price overall a good buy for the price 
1	navigation easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton 
0	battery life my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of 
0	battery there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours 
0	lock up i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times 
0	construction the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case 
0	case at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice 
1	storage navigation playlist battery pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery 
0	battery life manual lock up replacement battery battery life is about of that advertised no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players occasional software lockups replacement battery is expensive 
0	construction support scroll wheel headphone jack creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack 
0	build what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off 
0	support feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products 
0	scroll wheel the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device 
0	software the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers 
0	headphone jack enough people have reported that their headphone jack does nt work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem 
0	folder the zen does nt support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders documents and programs can t be launched from the zen so it is not a hard disk it is a storage device at best 
1	sound quality reviews for sound quality are generally positive 
1	price sure this thing is definitely more cost effective than an ipod 
0	quality but with a low price comes lower quality 
1	sound quality battery life price our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price

1	battery removable and cheap battery a li battery usually works properly for years 
1	value value comparing data storage with price 
1	appearance the appearance is okayed 
1	size the size is small 
1	use easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this 
0	mediasource the software mediasource cannot work on my pc 
0	software in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place 
1	display the display is awesome you can see everything you want and read it clearly 
1	storage huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you 
1	sound the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack

1	firmware the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any 
1	music the music plays awesome never skips even if u run for a bit so you can listen to music without interruption 
0	battery life the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with in this player is the battery life 
0	panel the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said 
0	transfer you need the software to actually transfer files 
0	player the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings

1	price and also it is priced very affordably 
1	storage with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more 
1	software the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair is notmad software because of some advanced features i wanted 
1	sound setting sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference 
1	accessing file accessing files by artist and album is easy and intuitive 
1	battery possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery 
1	battery since batteries do run out on everything this will also be a big money saver since ipods irivers rca dell all have built in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician 
1	value use try before you buy if at all possible although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface 
1	color i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy 
1	player i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it 
1	price price 
1	sound quality volume sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization 
0	earphone yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway 
1	interface i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough 
1	playlist i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer 
0	software creative software stinks 
0	cover the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day 
1	player have had the player since xmass and love it 
1	sound battery life battery storage screen firmware price great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price 
0	warranty freeze up navigation wheel short warranty occasional freeze up somewhat flimsy navigation wheel 
1	player this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod 
1	price for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some 
1	size design the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods 
1	build it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it 
1	control i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least 
1	scroll wheel the scroll wheel is better than the ipod is as well in that you do nt risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly just a small nudge of the finger and you re there 
1	screen the screen is large and easily read 
0	pop up face the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop off face that sometimes comes off a bit easily but besides that it is perfect 
1	sound sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod 
1	interface interface practically seamless 
1	id tag yet after ensuring that all the id tags are in order it actually turns out to be really handy 
1	playlist playlists can be generated on the fly or by using the software and there are a bevy of eq options 
0	balance the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance 
1	mediasource as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better 
1	mediasource it is easy to transfer preview and organize files 
1	id tag the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well 
1	software it was no problem for me to use their software 
1	player overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too 
1	equipment please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod 
0	player do nt buy this player 
0	player unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy 
0	player do nt buy this player 
0	product do not buy this product 
0	player i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy day warranty ended 
0	software the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb 
1	player honestly i love this player 
0	hard drive however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once 
1	break because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible 
0	player what a junk 
0	freeze every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes 
1	sound quality the sound quality is very good 
0	control software the controls are somewhat harder to use and there are some oddities about the software tagging system but most people can live with this 
1	storage having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific 
0	headphone jack typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others 
0	design i m convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed and will not hold up to normal use 
0	headphone jack the headphone jack seems to be a major problem 
0	front cover the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover which is taken off to have access to the battery seemed to come undone very easily 
0	headphone jack the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire 
0	lock up the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now 
0	hard drive in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class 
1	works works great no odor and uses regular bags 
1	diaper champ so far weve had no problems with the diaper champ at all 
1	diapers it contains the smell from our babys diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside 
1	odors refills i dont know if well run into trouble down the road with odors but so far i have no complaints and im very happy not to have to buy those refills 
1	diaper champ the diaper champ is the best we found 
1	bags there are no specail bags to deal with or buy 
1	bag we use the cheap gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around 
0	smelling now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will 
1	diaper we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it 
1	product it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and its fairly inexpensive as baby products go 
1	refills i love that you dont have to purchase expensive refills 
0	diaper wipes the cons at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth 
0	diaper champ in addition i dont believe that it is odorless 
0	odor my daughter is only months old and we do notice an odor 
1	diaper genie if i had to do it over again even with the cost savings of using any type of bag i would go w the diaper genie

1	convenient refills its easier and much more convenient to use because it doesnt have clumsy and confusing refills 
1	use there is no odor and extremely easy to use 
1	garbage bags it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills 
1	product it never smelled at all 
1	container the container is hard to open which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler and you do have to flip the handle carefully i dont consider these difficulties but features for the older baby 
0	size even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast 
0	size odor it seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless 
1	product this is a must have product for all new moms 
0	diaper genie the diaper genie needs its own refill bags in order to work and thats just more money that you dont have to spend 
1	work this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers 
0	item i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and cant tightly bundle it without a mess the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail 
0	fit my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesnt even fit a smaller sized garbage bag 
0	hole the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers and theyre on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un soiled they are 
1	fill unload it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie plus why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store 
1	diaper it also holds a lot more diapers 
1	size look at the size of it 
0	odor i have noticed an odor when unloading the diaper champ but at least you dont smell anything every time you use it 
1	diaper i highly recommend this 
0	diaper genie for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky 
1	diaper champ i have to say that i am very happy with it so far 
1	replacement i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont have to pay out the nose for replacements 
1	use its also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers 
1	champ the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle 
0	function but sometimes if the champ is too full the flip handle wont function 
0	diaper so i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper which i must remove usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full 
1	diaper pail i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it 
1	use the diaper champ couldnt be easier to use 
1	refills and the biggest plus is that you dont have to buy any expensive refills 
1	odor and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained which the diaper genie never did 
1	diaper champ if you are looking for a user friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained than the diaper champ is the one for you 
1	item use odor this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great 
1	diaper champ diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail 
1	holds it holds a lot of diapers not to mention the odor 
1	use its easy to use 
1	empty its also easy to empty out 
1	garbage bags and best of all no wasting money on special refill bags this takes ordinary garbage bags 
1	diaper pail whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers this is the truly the only diaper pail to get 
1	pail odor even though i never ventured into the cloth land i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life 
0	opening opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it 
1	refills being a very economical person i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills 
0	plunger as one other reviewer pointed out it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the plunger to get the diapers in the pail even though upon inspection the bag doesnt really look full 
1	emptying but from my experience by the time it gets to that point the bag is really heavy so i think this is kind of helpful its a built in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying 
1	gift this is a really great buy for yourself or as a shower gift 
1	champ go for the champ 
1	product i love this product 
1	dispose with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones 
1	trash bags plus the fact that it used regular trash bags is great 
1	refills no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require 
1	product and we still love it 
1	holds holds a lot of diapers a full week of toddler diapers 
1	trash bags we use our regular kitchen trash bags cheap 
1	odor holds the odor in nicely 
1	use easy one hand use impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail but that is rare and it usually just means that weve crammed too much in there and need to change the bag 
1	diaper champ we keep the diaper champ in our daughters nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers 
1	holds it holds quite a few diapers and pops them in quickly and easily 
1	trash bags i use the same store brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it no special diaper trash bags necessary 
0	opening the opening could be a little wider i suppose but i havent really seen anything else that could be improved 
1	works it works with a minimum of fuss 
1	diaper champ the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into what diaper smell in less time than that 
1	purchases this is one of the best purchases we made 
1	product use effective great product easy to use economical effective absolutly fabulous 
1	champ update i knew that i loved the champ and useing the diaper genie at a friends house really reinforced that 
1	champ odor there is no comparison the chanp is easy and smell free the genie was difficult to use one handed and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isnt any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ 
1	pail i love this pail 
1	smell ease of use garbage bags no smell easy to use with one hand free and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you dont get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find 
0	diaper pail solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesnt really contain the smell 
0	diaper pail i still like it a lot and am not changing it for another but it is sort of stinky 
1	diaper pail i think its great 
0	diaper pail i just wished that it didnt fill up so fast 
1	diaper pail it definitely keeps the smell out 
0	odor but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner 
1	odor first months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor 
0	odor but be prepared to buy something else which can trap the odor better 
1	diaper champ the diaper champ is the best 
1	champ i have tried other pails but none have compared positively to the champ 
1	use the champ is easy to use 
1	champ with the champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid 
1	dispose it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers 
1	store bags the champ uses regular store bags 
1	champ you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ 
1	champ the champ is odor free for at least months 
1	champ the champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year 
0	other pail the other pail i used started to smell after weeks of use 
1	champ regardless to this fact i believe the champ is the best way to go 
1	champ let the champ win you over 
1	odor no need for deodorizers 
1	empty i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty 
1	noise even did while daughter sleep and no noise 
1	smell i use the scented bags and even if i dont no smell 
1	space this holds alot and does not take up alot of space 
0	top loader we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used 
0	diaper champ we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only 
0	diaper wipes we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped 
1	diaper champ but like i stated its better then a trash can but im not sure if its better then the diaper genie
